<p class='c006'>ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>

<p class='c007'>UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD is a Magazine devoted to the promulgation of
the principles of the Brotherhood of Humanity in the widest sense. It is
an organ whose aim is to show that the Unity or Brotherhood of Mankind
is an actual fact in nature. If this principle were better understood by the
multitude or even by certain classes of Society there would be less strife and
competition and more sympathy and co-operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The demonstration of these broad ideas from the Ethical, Scientific and
Practical points of view will prove that there is much agreement between
these systems on this topic, and that it is an underlying ground-work by means
of which all Religions and all Philosophies agree also.</p>

<p class='c007'>This magazine will endeavor to show the great similarity between the
Religions of the world, in their fundamental beliefs and doctrines as also the
value of studying other systems than our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sound basis for ethics should be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who would assist the cause of Brotherhood should realize that it is
of the first importance to discover as much as possible concerning the nature of
man and man’s relation to the world around him. The laws that govern his
physical, mental, moral and spiritual being should be studied and investigated.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hoped that every sympathizer with the cause of brotherhood will endeavor
to assist us in enlarging the circulation of this magazine. Subscribers
will greatly oblige by sending us the names and addresses of individuals known
to them as willing to investigate liberal ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>All writers who are interested in the above objects are invited to contribute
articles.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in the hands of our readers to push the circulation of <span class='sc'>Universal
Brotherhood</span> to an almost unlimited extent. <b>All profits arising from the
publication of this magazine, or from the business conducted by the
Theosophical Publishing Co., are devoted to propaganda of Brotherhood.
All who assist us in this work are directly helping the great
cause of humanity.</b></p>

</div>

<div class='ic002'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The illustration of “Henry Clay
addressing Congress” exhibits,
with almost the exactness of portraits,
the likeness of the prominent
members of the American Senate at that
time. It is to be regretted that a key is
not given, as several of them, and these
not the men of less importance, are not
at this late period easily recognized. Yet
as we look upon their faces here delineated,
we feel as if we had known them
all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally our attention is first directed
to the figure of the one addressing the
Senate. The United States will have to
pass through another Civil War as destructive
of former memories as this one
has been, before Henry Clay can be forgotten.
Making his mark upon the history,
legislation and diplomacy of the
country, that mark cannot be removed
except the heart of the Nation is torn
out with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presiding officer we recognize as
Millard Fillmore, once a favorite son of
New York, and Vice-President in 1849
and 1850; then succeeding to the presidency
at the death of General Taylor.
Growing up from poverty and his few
opportunities, he became an accomplished
lawyer, a diligent legislator,
and a statesman of recognized ability.
Comely of person, graceful in manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>and generous in his impulses, he was at
the time one of the most popular men of
Western New York, and continued to be
till he signed the measure that operated
more than any other to estrange
the citizens of the Republic from one
another—the Fugitive Slave Act of 1851.</p>

<p class='c007'>We also observe near the speaker General
Lewis Cass, then the foremost man
of the Democratic Party, whose nomination
for President in 1852 Mr. Clay
desired and hoped for as most likely to
avert the crisis which he foresaw. He
then lay dying, but to the last the welfare
of his Country was at his heart.
But General Cass was passed over, and
the current moved with renewed force to
the final event. For years as Senator
and Cabinet Minister he put forth his
energy to arrest its progress, but was
compelled to give way overpowered.</p>

<p class='c007'>On beyond is John C. Calhoun, with
head bent forward, listening intently.
His, likewise, was a career of remarkable
significance in the Nation. He had
entered Congress almost at the same
time with Mr. Clay, and both in concert
with Langdon Cheves and William
Lowndes, who seemed to have been
elected for that purpose, put forth their
utmost efforts with success, to procure
a declaration of war with Great Britain.
The measure was regarded essential to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>the continuance of the Republican Party
in power, and Mr. Madison reluctantly
acceded to it, regretting his compliance
soon afterward. The next turn of the
wheel made Mr. Calhoun a Cabinet Minister,
and an aspirant for the presidency,
for which he had the support of Daniel
Webster. Falling short of that ambition,
he became the champion of State
Rights and nullification, bringing his
native commonwealth to the verge of
civil war, and himself into personal
peril. Thenceforth he set about educating
his people for mortal conflict. The
attempt to add new territory to this
country for the extending of the power
of the Southern as against the Northern
States, had brought nearer the crisis
which Mr. Clay was striving to avert.
It seems almost anachronism to place
Mr. Calhoun in this picture, for he died
in 1850.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daniel Webster, however, is the figure
soonest recognized. The artist has placed
him in a row a little way behind the
orator, sitting in a thoughtful mood, but
leaving us at a loss to surmise whether
he is attending to the subject under discussion,
or meditating upon some topic
which he may esteem to be of profounder
importance. He was translated to the
Cabinet a second time by President Fillmore,
but found himself without supporters
except personal friends and admirers,
and estranged from his political
associates. He quickly followed Mr.
Clay to the grave in 1852.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other faces in the picture seem familiar
and are carefully depicted. We
do not find, however, the “new men”
who had already come as precursors of
the next epoch in American history.
John P. Hale and William H. Seward
are left out, and we fail of finding
Daniel S. Dickinson, John Davis or
Stephen A. Douglas. Those whom we
do see there were undoubtedly regarded
as more notable, belonging as they did to
an era that seems to have passed almost
completely into oblivion. For it is true
however discreditable as it may seem,
that the events of that time and the men
of that time are almost as little cognized
by Americans of the present generation
as though they had been of the
period of Magna Charta and the Conference
of Barons at Runnymede.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war with Mexico resulting from
the annexation of Texas in 1845, had effected
the addition of New Mexico and
California to the jurisdiction of the United
States. Legislation was required to
provide for the exigency. An issue had
been introduced by the “Wilmot Proviso,”
declaring that neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except for crime,
should exist in the new territory. This
issue had decided the election of 1848
giving the Whigs the National Administration.
The organizing of Oregon
with this inhibition had created an
alarm. There were fifteen states with
slavery and fifteen without, so that each
region had an equal number of Senators.
This arrangement was now imperilled.
The contest was very sharp. Mr. Clay
apprehending danger to the Union, procured
the appointment of a joint Congressional
Committee to devise measures
of pacification. This Committee reported
what was known as the “Omnibus
Bill,” providing for the admission
of California as a State, the organization
of territorial governments for Utah
and New Mexico, and more effective
measures for the rendition of runaway
slaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is apparently in support of this
measure that Mr. Clay is speaking. The
prominent senators, the supporters of
this legislation, are listening. It may
be well to add that it did not pass in this
form, but that the several propositions
thus massed together, were afterward
enacted in separate bills.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Clay was always a conspicuous
character in American History. His
marked personality, his impressive manner,
his profound sincerity, his unquestioned
patriotism, his unblemished public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>career, his loyal friendship, his ardent
sympathy for the helpless and injured,
all combined to make him the
idol of his party. He was like Agamemnon,
a “king of men.” Even
when defeated, he never lost prestige,
but gained in the affection of those who
knew him. Ambitious, he certainly was,
for he aspired to the chief office in the
Republic, but he stubbornly refused to
employ unworthy means to secure the
prize. When the place was within his
grasp, and his supporters were buoyant
with assurance of success, he put it out
of his reach by exuberant frankness.
Yet the disappointment never weakened
his love of country, and his last efforts
were put forth to secure harmony in our
public councils and to preserve the Nation
undivided.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was the architect of his own fortunes.
His early opportunities were
limited, and he had never been able to
obtain a liberal education. His father
was a Baptist preacher, at that time of
no account in Virginia, and there was
no relationship with “first families.”
Henry Clay was strictly of the people
and a son of the people; his blood was
intensely red, without any tinge of patrician
blue. Early left an orphan he
ate the bread of poverty, and at a tender
age was taught to work for a livelihood,
to plough, to dig and labor in the harvest
field. He was generally known in the
region as “the Mill Boy of the Slashes.”
Fortunately for him when he was fourteen
years of age, his mother married a
second husband, a man quick to perceive
the ability of the youth and to find him
opportunity. He was placed for a year
in a retail store in Richmond, and afterward
in the office of the clerk of the
High Court of Chancery.</p>

<p class='c007'>A biographer describes him at this
period as raw-boned, lank and awkward,
with a countenance by no means handsome,
and dressed in garments home-made
and ill-fitting, with linen starched
to such a stiffness as to make him look
peculiarly strange and uncomfortable.
As he took his place at the desk to copy
papers, his new companions tittered at
his appearance, and his blushing confusion.
They soon learned to like him,
however, and he was found to be a faithful
and industrious worker. He read incessantly
during his hours of leisure but
unfortunately acquired a habit of cursory
perusing, a “skimming over”
which he never conquered, and which
seriously interfered with thoroughness.
This became afterward to him a source
of profound regret.</p>

<p class='c007'>His diligence at work attracted the attention
of the Chancellor, George Wythe,
who selected him for amanuensis to
write out and record the decisions of the
Court. This was the turning point of
his career. Wythe was a signer of the
Declaration of Independence and member
of the Convention that framed the
Federal Constitution. He believed in
what he promulgated, emancipating his
slaves and making provision for their
subsisting. Thomas Jefferson and John
Marshall had been his students. The
four years thus spent there decided Clay
to become a lawyer, and he entered the
office of Robert Brooke the Attorney-General
as a regular student. A year
later he received the license to practice.
At the age of twenty he set out for Kentucky
to seek his fortune, making his
residence at Lexington then styled “the
literary and intellectual centre of the
West.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He became, like all Southern men
of note, a politician, and quickly gained
distinction as a speaker. In 1797 a Convention
was held to revise the Constitution
of the State, and he labored assiduously,
but without success to procure the
adoption of a system of emancipation.
He saved his popularity, however, by
vigorously declaring against the Alien
and Sedition Laws of Congress. So
much easier is it to resent and deplore
the wrongs that others commit than to
repent of those we commit ourselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>Mr. Clay was from this time a champion
of the helpless and the wronged. It
required personal as well as moral courage.
There were men in Kentucky who
regarded themselves as leaders in Society
and above being held to account for unworthy
and lawless acts. Colonel Joseph
Daviess, then District Attorney of the
United States and a Federalist, perpetrated
a brutal assault upon a private
citizen. Everybody feared him but Mr.
Clay. He took the matter boldly up.
Daviess warned him to desist, but was
unable to frighten him even by a challenge
to a duel. With like sentiment
toward a man that he conceived to be
wronged, he became a defender of Aaron
Burr, but on learning of deception he refused
further friendly relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a period of service in the Legislature,
Mr. Clay was chosen to fill an
unexpired term in the Senate at Washington
and took his seat in December,
1806, when under thirty years of age.
He seems to have paid little heed to the
unwritten law of reticence, but took active
part in speaking and legislating.
He advocated the projects of a bridge
across the Potomac, and also roads and
canals to facilitate communication between
the Atlantic Seaboard and the
region west of the Allegheny Mountains.
A monument near Wheeling
commemorates his support of the Cumberland
Road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Political opinions then current have a
curious flavor now. Many questioned
the constitutionality of such legislation.
The establishment of a Navy was opposed.
The Barbary States received tribute
year by year for abstaining from
piracy on American Commerce. Great
Britain, claiming to be mistress of the
seas, took some six thousand seamen
from merchant vessels to serve in her
Navy, and confiscated goods that were
shipped to European markets. France,
likewise, issued decrees of forfeiture;
and all the defense attempted was an
embargo forbidding American vessels to
leave port. Spain pretended that her
possessions in West Florida extended to
the Mississippi River, and the Federalists
in Congress denounced the action of
President Madison to hold that region as
being a spoliation of a helpless and unoffending
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Clay had just come again to the
Senate. Although the youngest member
he was foremost in sustaining vigorous
action. “I have no commiseration for
princes,” said he; “my sympathies are
reserved for the great mass of mankind,
and I own that the people of Spain have
them most sincerely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned upon the great sensitiveness
exhibited toward Great Britain.
“This phantom has too much influence
on the councils of the Nation,” he declared.
“I most sincerely desire peace
and amity with England; I even prefer
an adjustment of differences with her before
one with any other Nation. But if
she persists in a denial of justice to us, or
if she avails herself of the occupation in
West Florida to commence war upon us,
I trust and hope that all hearts will unite
in a bold and vigorous vindication of our
rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Clay next appears as Speaker of
the House of Representatives in 1811.
The House was more to his liking than
the Senate; it was at that time a debating
body not dominated as it is now by
Committees appointed by the Presiding
Officer. He was vehement in demanding
preparations for war with England, and
talked of terms of peace to be dictated at
Halifax. The President was timid, and
the North and East opposed; but a declaration
was made, and Mr. Madison
proposed to make Mr. Clay Commander-in-chief.
This he declined. There was
a likelihood of cabals in Congress like
those which assailed General Washington
in the Revolution. The Navy saved
the credit of the Nation, which the Army
failed to sustain, and with that it averted
a peril of disunion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negotiations for peace were held at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>Ghent. Mr. Clay, as one of the Commissioners,
yielded a reluctant consent
to the treaty. He would not visit England
till he heard of the Battle of New
Orleans, but he went to Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an interview with Madame de
Stael, she spoke of the exasperation in
England and the serious intentions of
sending the Duke of Wellington to
America. “I wish they had,” said
Clay. “Why?” she asked. “Because,”
said he, “If he had beaten us we should
only have been in the condition of
Europe, without disgrace. But if we
had been so fortunate as to defeat him,
we should have greatly added to the renown
of our arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This conversation was repeated to the
Duke, who at once remarked that he
would have regarded a victory over the
Americans as a greater honor than any
which he had ever achieved. He also
praised the American Peace Commissioners
as having shown more ability than
those of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henceforth, Mr. Clay remained in his
own country. Mr. Madison tendered
him the mission to Russia but he declined.
He then offered him the portfolio
of the War Department. But Mr.
Clay chose rather to return to the House
of Representatives and was again elected
Speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now himself a leader; the men
who had been at the head of the Republican
Party from the time of Washington,
were passing from supremacy. The
war had developed new necessities and
new views of political subjects, and new
men were taking hold of public service.
What had been denounced in 1810 became
the policy of 1816; the Federal
party passed away, for its leaders had
offended the nation, and the new Republicans
had adopted their principal measures.
We now find Henry Clay and
John C. Calhoun still hand in hand,
with Daniel Webster the Union-lover
and John Randolph the Union-hater in
opposition, and the President still holding
the old traditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conditions of affairs in South
America was the occasion of a bill for
more strict enforcing of neutrality. Mr.
Clay dissented from the measure. The
ignorance and superstition imputed to
the people of the Spanish provinces, he
insisted, was due to the tyranny and oppression,
hierarchic and political, under
which they groaned. Their independence
was the first step toward improving
their condition. “Let them have free
government if they are capable of enjoying
it,” said he; “but let them, at all
events, have independence. I may be
accused of an imprudent utterance of my
feelings on this occasion. I care not.
When the independence, the happiness,
the liberty of a whole people is at stake,
and that people our neighbors, occupy a
portion of the same continent, imitating
our example and participating of the
same sympathies with ourselves, I will
boldly avow my feelings and my wishes
in their behalf, even at the hazard of
such an imputation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had exulted at the victory of New
Orleans by a Western General in a
Western State. But when General Jackson
in the Seminole War, enlisted volunteers
again without civil authority, invaded
Florida, decoyed Indian Chiefs
into his camp by a flag of truce and put
them to death, besides executing two
British subjects, Mr. Clay denounced
his acts as a disregard of every principle
of honor, humanity and justice. He
was, however, again in advance of popular
sentiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposed admission of Missouri
to the Union as a Slave State became an
issue for several years. It was a question
whether there should continue as
before an equal number of Free and
Slave States, so as to assure the latter a
safeguard in the Senate. It was interest
on one side and sentiment on the other.
The excitement was so intense as to
threaten the Union itself. Dissolution
was actually considered. The matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>was finally determined by a vote to admit
Missouri but to exclude slavery
from all the region west of it and north
of its southern boundary line. In this
controversy Mr. Clay acted with the
Southern Congressmen, and by his sagacity
as Speaker, the measure was made
sure: the conflict, however, to be again
renewed a third of a century later, transforming
the politics of a Nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of Mr. Clay’s speeches on this
question were published. He had been
constrained by the voice of his State and
fears for the safety of the Union, but he
was not willing to appear before his
countrymen and posterity in the lurid
light of sustaining slavery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The revolt in Greece enlisted the sympathy
of all America. Meetings were
held to declare the prevailing sentiment.
Albert Gallatin even proposed to aid
with a naval force. Mr. Webster offered
a resolution in Congress authorizing a
Commissioner to be sent to that country.
Mr. Clay supported the motion in his
Demosthenean style. After portraying
the situation, he added the challenge:
“Go home if you can; go home if you
dare, to your constituents, and tell them
that you voted this proposition down;
meet if you can, the appalling countenances
of those who sent you here, and
tell them that you shrank from the
declaration of your own sentiments; that
you can not tell how, but that some unknown
dread, some indescribable apprehension,
some indefinable danger, drove
you away from your purpose; that the
spectres of cimiters, and crowns, and
crescents, gleamed before you and
alarmed you; and that you suppressed
all the noble feelings prompted by religion,
by liberty, by national independence,
and by humanity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Clay had been already placed in
the field as a candidate for President,
and this temerity astonished his supporters.
He had enemies, likewise, to take
advantage of his excitable temper, to
irritate him to personal altercation.
John Randolph was conspicuous. He
taunted Mr. Clay for his defective education.
“I know my deficiencies,” Mr.
Clay replied. “I was born to no patrimonial
estate; from my father I inherited
only infancy, ignorance and indigence.
I feel my defects; but so far as my situation
in early life is concerned, I may
without presumption say they are more
my misfortune than my fault.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no political parties in 1824;
all were Republicans, and the contest
was simply between men. Mr. Clay was
approached with propositions such as
would now be considered legitimate.
He refused to enter into any arrangements
or make any promise or pledge.
There was no choice effected by the
Electors. In the Legislature of Louisiana,
advantage was taken of the absence
of members to deprive him of the vote
of that State. He was thus deprived of
the opportunity of an election by the
House of Representatives. It so happened,
however, that the decision was
in his hands, and he gave his vote to
John Quincy Adams. The two had differed
widely and with temper, but of
Mr. Adams’ superior fitness there was
no possible question. In political matters
he never rewarded a friend nor punished
an adversary. He administered
every trust conscientiously. Mr. Clay became
his Secretary of State. It was an
administration which the Nation would
like to witness again. The honor of the
Nation was sustained; the country was
prosperous beyond former periods. What
may now appear incredible, there were
twenty-four states in the Union, yet the
public expenditures barely exceeded
eleven million dollars a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The endeavor to effect a friendly alliance
with the new Spanish-American
Republics was unsuccessful. When Bolivar
wrote Mr. Clay a letter acknowledging
his good offices, he replied with a
gentle remonstrance against the establishing
of an arbitrary dictatorship. He
was disappointed in his hopes and expectations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>Mr. Adams had judged
those men better than he. In diplomacy
Mr. Clay aimed at reciprocity in commercial
matters. He advised the recognition
of Hayti likewise, as a sovereign
State.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also became one of the chief supporters
of the African Colonization Society.
He believed it possible to remove
a sufficient number of free negroes to reduce
sensibly the number of the colored
population, and bring about gradual
emancipation. “If,” said he, “I could
be instrumental in eradicating this
deepest stain upon the character of our
country, and removing all cause of reproach
on account of it by foreign nations;
if I could only be instrumental
in ridding of this foul blot that revered
State that gave me birth, or that not less
beloved State which kindly adopted me
as her son, I would not exchange the
proud satisfaction which I should enjoy
for the honor of all the triumphs ever decreed
to the most successful conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1828 a new administration and a
newly organized political party were
chosen. Mr. Clay returned to Kentucky.
But defeat never lessened his hold upon
his friends. In 1831 Daniel Webster,
voicing the sentiment of them all, wrote
to him: “We need your arm in the
fight. It would be an infinite gratification
to me to have your aid, or rather
your lead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Reluctantly he obeyed. He took his
seat in the Senate more heartily welcomed
by his friends, more bitterly hated
by his enemies, than ever before. From
this time he was more conservative. He
was henceforth the opposer of aggression,
the pacificator for the sake of the Union.
He was again nominated for President
by the Republicans in 1832. Some years
later the opposition united to form the
Whig Party, but although he was its
acknowledged leader, the anti-masonic
influence gave the nomination in 1840 to
Gen. Wm. H. Harrison. He was, however,
again nominated in 1844 and apparently
certain of election till a letter
was published in which he spoke of the
proposed annexation of Texas in ambiguous
terms which disaffected anti-slavery
voters enough to defeat him. He had
retired from the Senate two years before,
but came back under the new administration.
He foresaw peril to the Republic,
and now hoped to be able to stay the
tide. But it was only temporary.</p>

<p class='c007'>His personal appearance, as represented
in the picture, was unique. He
was tall and thin, though muscular;
and there was an entire absence of everything
like stiffness or haughtiness. His
manner was cordial and kind, inviting
rather than repelling approach. His
eyes were dark gray, small, and when
excited they flashed with striking vividness.
His forehead was high and broad.
His mouth was large, but expressive of
genius and energy. His voice was silvery,
deep-toned, and exquisitely modulated.
When speaking, he threw his
soul into the subject, carrying along the
souls of the hearers, making them assent
or dissent as he did. He spoke as the
patriot warrior of a thousand battles
would speak; and despite the enmity
and rancor which pursued him with
fiendish bitterness, the men opposed to
him mourned with his friends when he
was no more a denizen of earth.</p>

  <h2 id='wagner' class='c003' title='Richard Wagner&#39;s Prose Works.'>RICHARD WAGNER’S PROSE WORKS. <br /> BY BASIL CRUMP. <br /> VOLUME I.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The world knows Richard Wagner
as a daring musical genius; a
few know him as a poet who wrote
the poems for his own dramas; fewer
still know him as a writer, philosopher
and mystic. His voluminous prose
works are being translated into English
by Mr. W. Ashton Ellis, of the London
branch of the Wagner Society, and the
work will be completed by the end of
the century. When these writings become
familiar to the reading public,
Wagner will be much better understood
than he is now; the vast scope of his
work, and its harmonious relation to
other universal schemes of work which
make for the elevation of the human race,
will be more fully recognized. Then the
narrow and ignorant criticisms of a Nordau
or a Tolstoi, will have no foothold in
the mind of an enlightened public.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the previous series of articles
entitled “Richard Wagner’s Music
Dramas,” my purpose was to throw some
light on the inner meaning of those
dramas. In doing this some quotations
were made from the prose writings,
where Wagner has made actual explanations
or thrown out hints of his meaning.
In dealing with the prose works themselves,
my aim will be to show the basis
of Wagner’s reform in the field of dramatic
art, and the great motives which led
him to strike out a totally new path.
And here at the outset let me say that no
brief review of these volumes can possibly
convey any clear conception of
their contents; it will therefore be necessary
to devote several of these articles
to the more important essays. The volume
with which I am about to deal opens
with an</p>
<h3 class='c012'>AUTOBIOGRAPHIC SKETCH.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Wagner wrote this in 1843, at the request
of a German editor. In it we see
the germs of his future genius, and I will
select such details as serve to indicate
them. Wilhelm Richard Wagner was
born at Leipzig on May 22, 1813, and
learnt to play a little on the piano at the
age of seven. Two years later, when
the family migrated to Dresden, he used
to watch Weber “with a reverent awe,”
as the composer of <i>Der Freischütz</i> passed
to and fro to rehearsals. Thereupon his
piano exercises were speedily neglected
in favor of the overture to <i>Der Freischütz</i>
executed “with the most fearful fingering.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this music-strumming was quite
a secondary matter: Greek, Latin,
mythology and ancient history were my
principal studies.” At this time he
wrote some prize verses on the death of
a schoolfellow. “I was then eleven
years old. I promptly determined to become
a poet, and sketched out tragedies on
the model of the Greeks.” He also translated
twelve books of the Odyssey, and
learnt English in order to study Shakespeare.
“I projected a grand tragedy
which was almost nothing but a medley
of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King Lear</i>. The plan
was gigantic in the extreme; two-and-forty
human beings died in the course of
this piece, and I saw myself compelled
in its working out to call the greater
number back as ghosts, otherwise I
should have been short of characters for
my last acts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Being removed to the Leipzig <i>Nikolaischule</i>
he there for the first time came
into contact with Beethoven’s genius;
“its impression upon me was overpowering....
Beethoven’s music to <i>Eg-mont</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>so much inspired me, that I determined—for
all the world—not to allow
my now completed tragedy to leave the
stocks until provided with suchlike
music. Without the slightest diffidence,
I believed that I could myself write this
needful music, but thought it better to
first clear up a few of the general principles
of thorough-bass.... But this
study did not bear such rapid fruit as I
had expected: its difficulties both provoked
and fascinated me; I resolved to
become a musician.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far we see the embryo poet-musician.
In his sixteenth year the
mysticism in his nature was roused by a
study of E. A. Hoffmann: “I had visions
by day in semi-slumber, in which
the ‘Keynote,’ ‘Third,’ and ‘Dominant’
seemed to take on living form and reveal
to me their mighty meaning.” These
visions are curiously confirmed by the
scientific phenomena of Chladni’s sand
figures and the sound forms of Mrs.
Watts Hughes. The fact that sound is
the means through which all form is
produced is a very old teaching. Pythagoras,
who brought the art of music
from India to Greece, taught that the
Universe was evolved out of chaos by
the power of sound and constructed according
to the principles of musical proportion.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time Wagner seriously
studied Counterpoint under Theodor
Weinlig. In less than six months he
was dismissed as perfect. “What you
have made by this dry study,” he said
to his youthful pupil, “we call ‘Self-dependence.’”
In 1832 he composed “an
opera-book of tragic contents: <i>Die Hochzeit</i>”;
his sister disapproved of the
work and he at once destroyed it, although
some of the music was already
written. <i>Die Feen</i> (The Fairies) followed
in the next year and was the first of his
completed operatic works. At the age
of twenty-one he tells us: “I had
emerged from abstract Mysticism, and I
learnt a love for Matter.” The result
was <i>Das Liebesverbot</i> founded on Shakespeare’s
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, in which
“free and frank physicalism” prevails
over “Puritanical hypocrisy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This wild mood soon ceased under the
pressure of petty cares; in 1836 he married
the woman whose devotion helped
him through so many years of bitter
struggle. The following year he began
his first large work, <i>Rienzi</i>, and became
musical director at the Riga theatre.
The poem was finished in 1838, and in
1839 when the music was nearly completed,
Wagner embarked with his wife
and his beloved big dog on board a sailing
ship bound for London <i>en route</i> for
Paris. His object was to get <i>Rienzi</i> performed
there, but despite the influence
of Meyerbeer he was doomed to disappointment
and found himself stranded
there in the utmost poverty. This, as
we shall see from an essay later in the
volume, was the turning-point in his
life; but we have now to consider the
next essay, the famous</p>
<h3 class='c012'>ART AND REVOLUTION.</h3>
<p class='c011'>The main theme of this fine article is
the relation of Art to the Universal
Brotherhood of Man. It is prefaced by
an introduction written in 1872 which
begins with Carlyle’s trenchant words
on “that universal Burning-up, as in
hell-fire, of Human Shams.” Wagner
goes on to explain how the essay was
written “in the feverish excitement of the
year 1849.” This was the revolution
which cost him so many years of painful
exile at Paris and Zürich. He says
he was guided by an ideal which he
thought of as “embodied in a Folk that
should represent the incomparable might
of ancient brotherhood, while I looked
forward to the perfect evolution of this
principle as the very essence of the associate
Manhood of the Future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After some explanations of certain
technical words which might be misunderstood,
Wagner introduces us to the
essay itself. He begins by saying that
the essence of Modern Art is only a link
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>in a chain of causes started by the Ancient
Greeks. The Grecian spirit found
its fullest expression in the god Apollo:
“It was Apollo,—he who had slain the
Python, the dragon of Chaos ...
who was the fulfiller of the will of Zeus
upon the Grecian earth; who was, in
fact, the Grecian people.” Proceeding
then to connect Dance and Song, as inseparable
elements in early Greek Art,
he says: “Thus, too, inspired by Dionysus,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
the tragic poet saw this glorious
god; when to all the rich elements of
spontaneous art ... he joined the
bond of speech, and concentrating them
all into one focus, brought forth the
highest conceivable form of art—the
<span class='sc'>Drama</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That this Drama was a religious
teacher connected with the Mysteries is
very clearly brought out, and Wagner
draws a fine picture of one of those
great sacred days when thirty thousand
people assembled to witness “that most
pregnant of all tragedies, the <i>Prometheus</i>;
in this titanic masterpiece to see the
image of themselves, to read the riddle
of their own actions, and to fuse their
own being and their own communion with
that of their god.”</p>

<p class='c007'>How fell this glorious Tragedy? “As
the spirit of <i>Community</i> split itself along
a thousand lives of egoistic cleavage, so
was the great united work of Tragedy
disintegrated into its individual factors.”
For two thousand years since then Art
has given way to Philosophy; but
“True Art is highest freedom” and can
only arise out of freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows a splendid description of
the brutal materialism of the Romans
which hangs to this very day like a pall
about her ruins: “They loved to revel
in concrete and open bloodthirstiness.”
Mutual slavery of Emperor and people
was the result, and “self-contempt, disgust
with existence, horror of community”
found their expression in
Christianity. But this Christianity of
Constantine Wagner is careful to distinguish
from the teaching of “the
humble son of the Galilean carpenter;
who, looking on the misery of his fellow-men,
proclaimed that he had not come
to bring peace, but a sword into the
world; whom we must love for the anger
with which he thundered forth against
the hypocritical Pharisees who fawned
upon the power of Rome; ... and
finally who preached the reign of universal
human love.” In short, one
might say that Jesus and his teaching
stood in the same relation to the later
Christianity as Dionysus and the early
pure mysteries to the later degraded and
materialized Bacchic mysteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then in a very fine passage Wagner
indicts Modern Art, based, as it is, on
fame and gain and serving all the lower
needs of a debased public taste. The
Drama is separated into Play and Opera;
the one losing its idealizer—Music,—the
other, its dramatic aim and end: “What
serves it us, that <i>Shakespeare</i>, like a
second Creator, has opened for us the
endless realm of human nature? What
serves it, that <i>Beethoven</i> has lent to
Music the manly, independent strength
of Poetry? Ask the threadbare caricatures
of your theatres, ask the street-minstrel
commonplaces of your operas:
and ye have your answer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Think of it! This was written half a
century ago, and in spite of it the
Music Hall more than ever sways the
masses, and the cheap inanities of the
comic opera are the rage with the rest
of the community. I shall review the
remainder of this essay in the next
article.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>To be continued.</i>)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>
  <h2 id='lamartine' class='c003' title='Alphonse De Lamartine'>ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE. <br /> IV. POET, DIPLOMAT, TRAVELLER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Lamartine spent two winters at
Paris after the Restoration. His
former acquaintances were scattered,
and he had new ones to make. He
was for a time solitary and little occupied.
He was, nevertheless, resolute in
his quest for an opening into public life.
His friend Virieu and others introduced
him to persons of distinction and one
step led presently to another. The passion
for literature served to place him
on a friendly footing with others of similar
tastes, and he became able after a
while to enumerate among his acquaintances
Chateaubriand, the “Napoleon of
French literature,” Lamennais, the
French Savonarola, Rocher, Aimé  Martin,
De Vigny.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epoch of the Restoration was also
the epoch of the Revival of Letters in
France. The Revolution had sent
scholars and literary men to the scaffold
or driven them into exile, and Bonaparte
had attempted to level all learning
and philosophic culture to the plane of
physical and mathematical science.
Whatever might elevate the human soul
was not tolerated. He aspired to restore
the Sixteenth century at the end of the
Eighteenth and required literature to be
adapted to that end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis <abbr title='the eighteenth'>XVIII.</abbr> was always broad and
liberal in his sentiments, and even before
the Revolution he had cherished familiar
relations with literary men and men of
learning. His long term of enforced
leisure, during his absence from France,
and a weakness in his limbs which compelled
him to sedentary life, had tended
to deepen his interest in such pursuits.
He was emphatically a king of the fireside.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emigrants that returned with him
to France, had but imperfectly apprehended
the change. Those most bigoted
formed a coterie around the Count D’Artois;
others endeavored to qualify the
action of the King. Hence the court
was a combination of old royalty with a
new order of things.</p>

<p class='c007'>A galaxy of stars of the first magnitude
was now shining in France. Naturally
Lamartine was dazzled by them
when he came to Paris. Observing that
several young men were recognized in
the literary world, he again cherished
the notion of publishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>While himself without employment
he conceived the plan of a long poem and
actually wrote several cantos. It was
to be the history of a human soul and its
migrations through successive terms of
existence and forms of experience till
its eventual reunion to the Centre of the
Universe, God.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also projected and began several
other compositions. He labored incessantly
to perfect his style, till it became,
though diffuse, a model of elegance, energy
and correctness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had from time to time written
verses to which he gave the title of <i>Meditations</i>.
Friends slyly pilfered these,
and gave copies to ladies of their acquaintance.
These passed from hand
to hand till they came to the table of
Talleyrand himself. The prince greatly
admired them and his praises were repeated
to the Marquise de Raigecourt.
This lady had been an intimate friend of
the Princess Elizabeth. Lamartine had
been introduced to her by the Count de
Virieu, and she took a motherly interest
in his welfare. Yet he could not bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>himself to go to the Court. “I was
born wild and free,” he says for himself,
“and I did not like to bend down
in order to rise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1815 to 1818 when at home, he
composed several tragedies—Medée, one
relating to the Crusades, and Saul. He
had a hope that by them he might gain
some celebrity and perhaps contribute
something to the fortune of his parents
and sisters. He completed them in the
spring of 1818, and having copied them
in a plain hand hurried with them to
Paris. He solicited an interview with
Talma who granted it at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>On invitation, he read extracts from
the tragedy entitled Saul. The great
tragedian listened attentively, and was
for some time silent. His first words
were: “Young man, I have desired to
know you for twenty years. You would
have been my poet. But it is too late.
You are coming to the world and I am
going from it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then requested Lamartine to tell
him frankly, as a son to a father, his
personal history, his family relations,
and his wishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he did and told how he had desired
to work, to come out of his obscurity,
to produce something that would be
an honor to the name of his father and a
comfort to the heart of his mother. He
had thought of Talma. He had written
several tragedies, of which this was a
specimen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you be good enough,” he implored,
“to hold out your hand and help
me succeed by the stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tears stood in Talma’s eyes. He
praised the work, and declared that in
the reign of Louis XIV. it would have
won applause. But now, tragedy had
been superseded, in general estimation,
by the drama. He counselled Lamartine
to study Shakespeare, to forget art
and study nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Lamartine came again to Paris
the next winter, he asked him to write
for the stage. But Lamartine coveted a
public rather than a literary career, and
applied to M. Pasquier, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, for a diplomatic appointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now present at the <i>salons</i> or
drawing-room parties of the Duchess de
Raigecourt, the Duchess de Broglie,
Madame de Stael’s daughter, Madame
de Ste. Aulaire, Madame de Montcalm,
the sister of the Duke de Richelieu. At
these he was introduced to persons of
distinction. Madame de Sainte Aulaire,
who had a divining faculty for discerning
young persons who were destined to
achieve a career, took a warm interest in
his behalf. She invited him to read
several pages of his unpublished verses,
and afterward encouraged him to print
them. He was then recovering from a
severe illness. Booksellers, however,
objected to the novelty of the style, and
he was able only by obstinate perseverance
to induce one to undertake the risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Lamartine was harassed by a new
apprehension. The book, whether it
broke like an egg by falling to the
ground, or proved a successful venture,
was liable, although anonymous, to be
a source of perplexing complications.
The notion of specialties in work was current,
and the fact of being an author and
writer of verses, might be an obstacle to
his hopes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madame de St. Aulaire was a relative
of the minister, M. Decazes. She and
her husband put forth their influence
with the Government in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the same time, M. Jules Janin,
then at the beginning of his career, finding
a copy of the <i>Meditations</i> at a book-store,
purchased it out of curiosity. He
found to his astonishment, a new style
of poetry; that it admirably depicted
the sentiments of the soul and passions
of the heart, the joys of earth and the
ecstasies of heaven, the hopes of the
present and apprehensions of the future.
He wrote a long review, which served
to arouse the attention of the literary
and book-reading public and to create a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>prodigious demand. Forty-five thousand
copies were sold in the next four years,
and its author was speedily ranked with
Byron, Goethe and Chateaubriand, then
the distinguished poets of the period.
He had originated a new style of poetry.</p>
<h3 class='c012'>DAY-BREAK OF FORTUNE.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Lamartine was sadly awaiting
events at his modest quarters and
fearing for the fate and effects of his little
publication. As he was in bed one
morning in the first month of spring,
the janitor’s daughter, a girl of twelve
or fourteen years, opened the door of the
room. It was too early for the morning
newspaper. Smiling intelligently, she
threw on the bed a little billet having
an enormous seal of red wax. There
was upon it, Lamartine remarks, “an
imprint of a coat of arms that ought to be
illustrious, for it was undecipherable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you smile so knowingly,
Lucy?” he asked, as he broke the seal
and tore off the envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because,” said she, “mamma told
me that the letter had been brought in
the early morning by a chasseur all
laced with gold, having a beautiful
feather in his hat, and that he had urgently
desired that the note should be
delivered to you as soon as you awoke,
because his mistress had told him: ‘Go
quickly; we must not delay the joy and
perhaps the fortune of the young man.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two separate epistles.
One was written by the Polish Princess
T.... She was a sister of the unfortunate
Prince Poniatowski who was
drowned while directing the retreat at
the battle of Leipsic. Lamartine did not
know her and the letter was not addressed
to him but to M. Alain, his friend and
physician. M. Alain had been for six
years the physician and friend of M. de
Talleyrand, and during Lamartine’s illness
he had cared for him like a mother
rather than as a medical attendant. He
is depicted as being as tender as learned.
Lamartine describes him as most true,
good, and generous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter of the princess had been
written and despatched before daybreak,
and was as follows:—“The Prince de
Talleyrand sent me at my waking this
note. I address it for your friend, in
order that the pleasure which this impression
of the great judge will bring
you shall be doubled. Communicate
this note of the Prince to the young
man<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and thank me for the pleasure
which I am giving you, for I know that
your sole delight is in the joy of those
whom you love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine opened the second note.
It was written upon a scrap of paper
about five fingers in dimension, spotted
with ink, and in a hand evidently hurried
and showing signs of fatigue from
want of sleep. It began as follows:—“I
send you, princess, before I go to
sleep the little volume which you lent
me last night. Let it suffice you to
know that I have not slept, and that I
have been reading till four o’clock in
the morning so as to read it over again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of the note was a prediction
of Lamartine’s success, in terms of the
most fulsome character. Talleyrand was
often oracular, and his foreknowledge
seemed almost infallible.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> “The soul of
the old man has been said to be of ice,”
Lamartine remarks, “but it glowed all
one night with the enthusiasm of twenty
years, and this fire had been kindled by
certain pages of verses which were by no
means complete but which were verses
of love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I read the letter of Prince Talleyrand
twenty times over,” says Lamartine.
“The young girl meanwhile was waiting
and watching me as I read and read
again, and she blushed with emotion as
she beheld it in my face. ‘Come, my
little Lucy, and let me kiss you,’ said I.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>‘You will never bring me a message
equal to this. In the lottery of glory
children draw the successful lots. Tell
your mother that you have brought me
a <i>quine</i>.’”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine’s book was thus placed in
the lottery of fortune, and the name of
Talleyrand had been called. The great
statesman was not in public life at that
time, but he was far-seeing, and his
scent of public matters was well-nigh
infallible. He had no interest to flatter
the unknown writer, and Lamartine accepted
his assurances as a favorable
augury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely enough, little Lucy, a quarter
of an hour later, brought another letter
in a large official envelope. Lamartine’s
friends had been successful in their pleadings,
and this was his nomination, signed
by M. Pasquier, to the post which he desired
on the Legation to Florence.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the reading of this document, Lamartine
was for a time unable to restrain
his emotions. He leaped down from the
bed, he tells us, and in other ways exhibited
his delight. He was not content,
however, to exult in his actual good fortune,
but immediately began to extend
his imagination further.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I experienced what the shackled
courser does when the course is opened,”
says he. “I had little mind for the glory
of verses, but I did have an unbounded
passion for political activity. Already
I began to look beyond the long years
that separated me from the tribune and
field of higher statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was my true and entire vocation,
although my friends think and my enemies
say otherwise. I felt that mine was
not the powerful creative organization
that constitutes great poets; all my talent
was of the heart only. But I did feel
in me an accuracy of view, an effective
power of reasoning, an energy of honest
principle, which make statesmen. I had
somewhat of the quality of Mirabeau in
the reserved mental forces of my being.
Fortune and France have since decided
otherwise. But Nature knows more
than Fortune and France; the one is
blind, the other is jealous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, Lamartine continued to
write verses, and his prose publications
are more or less interspersed with poetic
productions. He praised his friends, he
commemorated those whom he loved in
poems. Years afterward in his story of
his journey to the Holy Land, he made
this declaration: “Life for my mind has
always been a great poem, as for my
heart it has been love. <span class='sc'>God</span>, <span class='sc'>Love</span> and
<span class='sc'>Poesie</span>, are the three words which I shall
desire to be engraved alone upon my
monument if I ever deserve a monument.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was sitting in a mystic reverie
one evening at Florence, he heard a
melodious voice murmur in his ear some
lines from the <i>Meditations</i>, which are
rendered as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Perchance the future may reserve for me</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A happiness whose hope I now resign:</div>
      <div class='line'>Perchance amid the busy world may be</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some soul responsive still to mine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He was also a member of the Legation
to England and afterward became Secretary
to the French Embassy at Naples.
In 1824 he was appointed Chargé
d’Affaires to Tuscany, and remained in
that position five years. He made the
acquaintance of Louis Bonaparte, the
former King of Holland, who was a scientist
and philosopher rather than a
statesman. Queen Hortense also attempted
to have an interview with him,
but this he carefully evaded. His mother,
however, was a relative of the wife of
Lucien Bonaparte and he met several
members of that family under circumstances
somewhat romantic. Pierre
Bonaparte was with him at Paris in the
Revolution of 1848.</p>

<p class='c007'>His older uncle died in 1823, and he
became heir of the estates. This uncle
was known as M. de Lamartine de Monceau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>and was by seniority the head of
the family. He had never married because
his parents opposed the choice he
had made. He was thrifty and had increased
the value of his property. Lamartine
now took his uncle’s designation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marriage of Lamartine took place
during this period. The bride was Miss
Marianne Birch, an English lady of
beauty and fortune. She was of amiable
disposition and Lamartine’s mother
became warmly attached to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither the accession of wealth, his
aristocratic rank, nor diplomatic engagements
deterred him from literary
composition. In 1823 the <i>Nouvelles
Meditations</i> were published, and two
years later, <i>The Last Canto of Childe
Harold</i>. Lamartine afterward described
this latter work as a servile imitation in
which his enthusiasm as a copyist and
its success were alike “mediocre”—a
punishment for feigning an admiration
which was not altogether sincere. He
had, likewise, another penalty to encounter.
Two lines in it are versified in
English as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I seek elsewhere (forgive, O Roman shade!)</div>
      <div class='line'>For men, and not the dust of which they’re made.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For this apparent slur he was involved
in a controversy leading to a
duel and dangerously wounded. At his
solicitation to the Grand Duke of Tuscany,
his antagonist, Colonel Pepé, was
not prosecuted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis <abbr title='the eighteenth'>XVIII.</abbr> was succeeded in 1824
by the Count d’Artois as Charles <abbr title='the tenth'>X.</abbr>
The attempt was now made to reinstate
the Government as it existed before the
Revolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1829, at the instance of Chateaubriand,
then a member of the Coalition
Ministry, Lamartine was recalled. He
never ascertained the reason, but attributed
it to the influence of Madame Recamier,
with whom Chateaubriand was
intimate. That lady, however, took an
early opportunity to set the matter right
by visiting the mother and sisters of
Lamartine and inviting him and them to
a drawing-room entertainment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reactionist Ministry under M. de
Polignac was formed in the autumn of
that year. It was the final separation
of the men of the former century from
the men of the time. A portfolio was
offered to Lamartine but declined. He
was attached to the dynasty, but he had
the prescience of its overthrow. “I had
seen it coming from afar,” says he.
“Nine months before the fatal day, the
fall of the new monarchy had been written
for me in the names of the men
whom it had commissioned to carry it
on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was sent on a special mission to
Prince Leopold, then Duke of Saxe-Cobourg,
and afterward King of Greece;<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
and had received the appointment of ambassador
to that country when the Revolution
of July overthrew the dynasty.
The ministry of Louis-Philippe then offered
him his choice of the embassies to
Vienna and London. The King visited
him to solicit his acceptance, but he was
inexorable. The title of Louis-Philippe
was legally defective; he was not the
next heir to the throne, and he had not
been placed on it by the choice of the
people of France. For these reasons it
was important to him that the supporters
of Charles <abbr title='the tenth'>X.</abbr> should accept places
under him and thus strengthen his pretensions.
But says Lamartine: “One
should not take part gratuitously in a
fault which he did not himself commit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>M. de St. Aulaire was at that time
Minister at Vienna, but greatly desired
to be transferred to England. He also
waited upon Lamartine, anxious to find
out which place he was going to accept.
Lamartine quickly assured him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If,” said he, “I had the ambition to
be ambassador to London, I would instantly
sacrifice it without hesitation, in
remembrance of the good offices which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>you did to me at the time of my entrance
into the great world. But you can go
to London without any indebtedness to
me, except good will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same year Lamartine was elected
one of the “Immortals,” in the French
Academy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same year he visited England.
He there made the acquaintance of
Talleyrand. The old statesman received
him cordially, and in one interview predicted
his career. Lamartine, he remarked,
was reserving himself for something
more sound and grand than the
substituting of an uncle for a nephew
upon a throne that had no stable foundation.
“You will succeed in it,” he
added. “Nature has made you a poet;
poetry will make you an orator; tact
and thinking will make you a statesman.
I know men somewhat; I am
eighty years old. I see farther than the
objects in sight. You are to have a
grand part to perform in the events
which will succeed to the present state
of affairs. I have witnessed the intrigues
of Courts; you will see the movements
of the people deceptive in other ways.
Let verses go; you know that I adore
yours. They are not for the age in which
you are now living. Improve yourself in
the grand eloquence of Athens and
Rome. France will yet have scenes like
those of Rome and Athens in her public
places.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period Lamartine spent
much of his time abroad. He never forgot
that he was a citizen of France, but
he entertained a strong dislike for the
Orleans dynasty. Yet his mother had
been educated in the family with the
King, and this somewhat increased his
perplexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>He writes of her death pathetically, as
the saddest event of his life. He had
been loved and cherished by her with a
devotion made sublime by its absolute
self-abnegation. His first lessons in
books and knowledge had been given by
her, and he was endowed personally with
her most prominent characteristics. She
had seemed to know instinctively when
and why he suffered, and she possessed
a power of divination to foresee his career.
Her death, the result of a terrible
accident, was to him like the rending
violently away of a vital part of his
body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly thought that I could survive
the shock,” he wrote in the <i>Souvenirs</i>.
“I was absent from home when
the accident occurred which cut short
her days. I came back in haste, arriving
in time to follow the coffin in which
her remains were enshrouded, to the
cemetery of the village where we had
lived during our infancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather was bitterly cold, but this
he did not feel. He returned to the house
at Milly, now empty for the winter and
a thousand times more empty since she
who had given it life and soul was sleeping
the eternal sleep. Overcome by his
grief, he made his way to the little room
where the papers of the family were kept,
and threw himself down on the floor.
There he lay for hours in an ecstasy of
woe. The moaning of the wind and the
ticking of the clock seemed to be repeating
the funeral hymn.</p>
<h3 class='c012'>JOURNEY TO THE EAST.</h3>
<p class='c011'>One desire that the mother of Lamartine
had instilled into him was that of
visiting the East. As she read to him,
a boy of eight years, from the Bible
about the places where wonderful events
had taken place, he resolved that he
would some time behold them with his
own eyes. Now that he was disengaged
from public life there was an opportunity.
There was much, however, to
persuade him to remain at home; his
father and sisters, and besides, he had a
beautiful residence at Saint-Point with a
wife and daughter to whom he was fondly
attached. But he felt that imagination
had likewise its necessities and passions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was born a poet,” he pleads.
“When young, I had heard the word of
Nature, the speech which is formed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>images and not of sounds. I had even
translated into written language some of
those accents that had stirred me, and
that had in their turn stirred other souls.
But these accents did not now satisfy
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Besides, I was, I had almost always
been, a Christian in heart and in imagination;
my mother had made me such.”
This pilgrimage though not as of the
Christian, at least of the man and the
poet, would delight her in the celestial
abode where he saw her, and she would
be to them as a second Providence between
them and dangers.</p>

<p class='c007'>His duty to his country was likewise
considered. He had sacrificed to it this
dream of his for sixteen years. There
was need for heaven to raise up new
men; the present politics made man
ashamed and angels weep. “Destiny
gives an hour in a century for humanity
to be regenerated; that hour is a revolution;
and men let it pass to tear one
another to pieces: thus they give to revenge
the hour given by God for their
regeneration and progress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All was duly made ready for the journey.
He set sail from Marseilles, in the
brig <i>Alceste</i>, on the eleventh of July,
1832, expecting to be absent two years.
His wife and daughter and three friends,
one of them a physician, composed the
party. The voyage was full of incident,
and his journal abounds with adventures
and predictions. Lamartine was
what imaginative persons term a visionary.
He was really oriental and tropical
in temperament, and ready to catch the
spirit of the region to which he was sailing;
for Syria, Arabia and Palestine
have always been renowned for mystics,
seers and prophets.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the vessel passed the coast of Tunis,
he wrote his impressions. He had never
loved the Romans nor taken the least
interest in behalf of Carthage; but he
sympathized with Hannibal. “I love or
I abhor, in the physical sense of the
word,” says he. “At first sight, in the
twinkling of an eye, I have formed my
judgment of a man or woman for always.”
He adds that “this is the characteristic
of individuals with whom instinct
is quick, active, instantaneous,
inflexible. What, it will be asked, what
is instinct? It is to be cognized as the
highest reason—the innate reason, the
reason that does not argue, the reason
such as God has made and not what man
finds out. It strikes us like the lightning
without which the eye would have
difficulty of searching it out. It illuminates
everything at the first flash. The
inspiration in all the arts, as upon the
field of battle, is as this instinct, this
reason that divines. Genius also is instinct
and not logic and labor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless he sets aside much that
is often regarded as original, or inspired.
This utterance is fit for the book of
<i>Ecclesiastes</i>: “There is nothing new in
nature and in the arts. Everything that
is now being done has been done before;
everything that is said has been said already;
everything that is thought has
been thought. Every century is the
plagiarist of another century; for all
that we are so much, artists or thinkers,
perishable or fugitive, we copy in different
ways from one immutable and eternal
model,—nature, the thought, one
and diverse, of the Creator.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had little to say in favor of the
Greeks. “For me,” says he, “Greece
is like a book the beauties of which are
tarnished, because we have been made to
read it before we were able to understand
it. Nevertheless, the enchantment
is not off from everything. There
is still an echo of all those great names
remaining in my heart. Something holy,
sweet, fragrant, mounts up with the
horizons in my soul. I thank God for
having seen, while passing by this land,
the country of the Doers of Great Deeds,
as Epaminondas called his fatherland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt keenly a sense of isolation that
he had no one to participate in these
sentiments. “Always,” says he, “when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>a strong impression stirs my soul I feel
the necessity to speak or to write to some
one of what I am experiencing, to find
in some degree a joy from my joy, an
echoing of that which has impressed me.
Isolated feeling is not complete: man
has been created double. Ah! when I
look around me, there is yet a void.
Julia and Marianne fill everything for
themselves alone; but Julia is still so
young that I tell her only what is suited
to her age. It is all future; it will soon
be all present for us; but the past,
where is it now?</p>

<p class='c007'>“The person who would have most
enjoyed my happiness at this moment,
is my Mother. In everything that happened
to me, pleasant or sad, my thought
turns involuntarily to her. I believe I
see her, hear her, talk to her, write to
her. One who is remembered so much
is not absent; whoever lives so completely,
so powerfully in ourselves is not
dead for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Empty dream! She is there no
more; she is dwelling in the world of
realities; our vagrant dreams are no
more anything to her; but her spirit is
with us, it visits us, it follows with us,
it protects us: <i>our conversation is with
her in the eternal regions</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He goes on to describe his condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Before I had reached the age of maturity
I had lost the greater part of those
here below whom I most loved, or who
most loved me. My love-life had become
concentrated; my heart had only a
few other hearts to take voyage with.
My memory had little more than graves
where it might rest here in the earth; I
lived more with the dead than with the
living. If God were to strike two or
three of his blows around me, I feel that
I would be detached entirely by myself,
for I would contemplate myself no more.
I would love myself only in the others;
and it is only there that I can love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One begins to feel the emptiness of
existence from the day when he is no
more necessary to anybody, from the
hour when he can no more be dearly
loved. The sole reality here below, I
have always felt, is love, love under all
its forms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To us poets, beauty is evident and
perceptible; we are not beings of abstraction,
but men of nature and instinct;
so I have travelled many times
through Rome; so I have visited the
seas and the mountains; so I have read
the sages, the historians and the poets;
so have I visited Athens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the fifth of September the brig arrived
at Bayreuth. Lamartine engaged
a house for the season and established
his family there while he travelled over
the country. He had for a long time entertained
grave doubts of his daughter’s
health, and had brought her with him
in the hope that a residence in Syria
would restore her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ibrahim Pacha was at this time making
his conquests, and at his orders, the
French travellers were everywhere received
with courtesy and the most generous
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heat was too great for setting out
at once, so Lamartine addressed a letter
to Lady Hester Stanhope, asking permission
to visit her. This lady had
been the confidential secretary of her
uncle, William Pitt, the famous minister,
and was supposed to be betrothed
to Sir John Moore. After their deaths
she left Europe and made her home in
the East. She had gained a certain authority
over many of the Arabian chiefs
who venerated her as an inspired person.
She received Lamartine cordially, saying
that their stars were friendly and in concurrence.
He declined her offer to cast
his horoscope or to have any discussion
on matters of religion. “God alone
possesses the truth,” said he, “we have
only faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Believe what you please,” said she.
“You are one of those men nevertheless
that I expected, whom Providence has
sent to me, and who have a grand part to
perform in the work which is preparing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>You will shortly go back to Europe;
Europe is finished. France alone has as
yet a grand mission to fulfill, and you
will participate in it, I know not how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She added that he had four or five
stars, and explained further: “You
ought to be a poet; that is legible in
your eyes and the upper part of your
countenance. Lower down you are under
the influence of different stars that
are almost in opposition; there is an influence
of energy and activity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She asked his name; she had never
heard it before. She predicted that he
would soon return to Europe, but would
come back to the East, insisting that it
was his fatherland. He acknowledged
that it was the fatherland of his imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine and his friends were hospitably
entertained but she would not
regard his departure as being more than
for a season.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forming a caravan at Bayreuth he set
out on the eighth of October. At Jaffa
or “Yaffa,” the governor had received
letters from Mehemet Ali and Ibrahim
Pacha, then masters in the East, commanding
all the officials to aid him in
his journey, to furnish escorts, and to
supply him with every convenience that
he required. When the caravan reached
the “village of Jeremiah” it was met by
Abu Gosh, the brigand chief. He demanded
of Lamartine whether he was
the Frank Emir, whom his friend, Lady
Stanhope, the Queen of Palmyra, had
placed under his protection, and in
whose name had sent him the magnificent
garment of cloth of gold in which
he was then arrayed. Lamartine knew
nothing of the gift but assured the chief
that he was the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abu Gosh at that time had the whole
region of Southern Palestine in subjection
clear to Jericho. He now provided
a strong guard for the caravan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine found no difficulty in identifying
the places around Jerusalem. “Almost
never,” says he, “did I encounter
a place or object the first sight of which
was not to me as what I remembered.
Have we lived twice or a thousand
times? Is our memory simply an impression
that has been obscured, which
the breath of God brings out again
vividly? Or have we a faculty in our
imagination to anticipate and perceive
in advance before we actually do behold?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The monks of the Convent of St. John
the Baptist, in the wilderness of that
name, received the travellers with sincere
cordiality. Lamartine left there a
part of his caravan, going on only with
the Arabian and Egyptian guard. They
confined their movements to visiting
places in the suburbs, made historic by
traditions of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c007'>He pays a deserved tribute to the
Turks for their management of the “Holy
Sepulchre.” Instead of destroying it,
they had preserved everything, maintaining
strict police regulations, and a
silent reverence for the place which the
Christians were far from manifesting.
While the intolerance of the various
sects would lead the triumphant party
to exclude its rivals from the place, the
Turks are impartial to them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mussulmans are the only tolerant
people, he stoutly affirms. Let Christians
ask what they would have done if
the fortunes of war had delivered to
them the City of Mecca and the Kaaba.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the thirtieth of October, the caravan
set out for the river Jordan and the
Dead Sea. On returning to the neighborhood
of Jerusalem, Lamartine received
a letter from his wife that determined
him to forego the extending of
his journey into Egypt. He went back
to Bayreuth, arriving the fifth of November.</p>

<p class='c007'>Autumn in that country has the
warmth, the renewing of vegetation
and other conditions, like spring in the
northerly climates of the temperate zone.
Lamartine had purchased Arab horses
of superb quality while in Palestine, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>one for his daughter. It was at the end
of November that he took her out for
her first excursion with the animal. The
air was exhilarating and the mountain
scenery in its most attractive guise. In
an ecstasy of excitement the young girl
declared it the longest, most beautiful,
most delightful ride that she had ever
taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also the last. On the second of
December she was taken suddenly ill
and died the next day. The parents
were overwhelmed with grief. The last
hope of their house was thus cut off in
the glad days of adolescence.</p>

<p class='c007'>They remained at Bayreuth through
the winter. On the fifteenth of April
they set out for their return homeward
and sailed for Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine interspersed his narrative
of this voyage with reflections upon what
he observed and meditated. “I would
like to sail all the while,” says he, “to
have a voyage with its chances and distractions.
But what I read in my wife’s
eyes goes deep into my heart.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
suffering of a man is nothing like that of
a woman, a mother. A woman lives and
dies in one sole thought, or one solitary
feeling. Life for a woman is a something
possessed; death, a something
lost. A man lives with everything that
he has to do with, good or bad; God
does not kill him with a blow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the subject of travelling and sojourning
abroad, he speaks philosophically:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When a man is absent from his
country, he sees affairs more perfectly.
Details do not obstruct his view, and
important matters present themselves in
their entireness. This is the reason why
prophets and oracles lived alone in the
world and remote. They were sages who
studied subjects in their entirety and
their judgment was not warped by the
little passions of the day. The statesman,
likewise, if he would judge and
foresee the outcome, must often absent
himself from the scene in which he performs
the Drama of his time. To predict
is impossible, for foreknowledge is
for God alone; but to foresee is possible,
and forethought is for man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lamartine analyzes closely the doctrines
of Saint-Simonism, and what he
considers their weak points. “We must
not,” he says, “judge new ideas by the
derision which they encounter during
the period. All great thoughts were first
received in the world as aliens. Saint-Simonism
has in it a something true,
grand and beautiful; the application of
Christianity to civil society, the legislation
of Human Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From this point of view I am a Saint-Simonian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has placed this Society under
an eclipse, though not under death, is
not the want of an idea, nor the lack of
disciples. In my opinion it wants a
leader, a master, a manager. If there
should be found a man of genius and
virtue who was religious and at the same
time prudent, who would bring the two
horizons into one field of vision which
should be placed under the direction of
the nascent ideas, I have no doubt that
he would transform it into a potent reality.
Times in which there is an anarchy
of ideas, are favorable seasons for the
germinating of new and heroic thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Society, to the eye of the philosopher,
is in a state of disorder. It has
neither direction, object nor leader; and
it is reduced accordingly to the instinct
of conservatism. A sect that is religious,
moral, social and political,—that has a
creed, a watchword, an object, a leader,
and mind, if it were to advance compactly
and directly at the midst of the
disordered ranks in the present social
order, would inevitably gain the victory.
But it must bring safety and not ruin,
attacking only what is injurious and not
that which helps, and calling religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>back to reason and love, prudence and
Christian Brotherhood, having universal
charity and usefulness as its only title
and only foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A law-maker requires young men
ardent in zeal and on fire with the hunger
for faith, from which however, senseless
dogmas have been rejected. The
organizers of Saint-Simonism have
taken for their first article of belief:
war to the death between the family,
property and religion on one hand and
ourselves on the other. They ought to
perish. The world, by the force of speech
is not conquered; it is to be converted,
stirred, wrought into activity, changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So long as an idea is not practical, it
is not presentable to the world of society.
Human nature goes from the known to
the unknown, but not from the known
to the absurd. That will be held back
in the subordinate effort. Before great
revolutions, the signs are to be seen on
the earth and in the sky. The Saint-Simonians
have had one class of those
signs: they have broken up as a body,
and they are now more slowly at work
making leaders and soldiers for the new
army.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The vessel and its convoy arrived in
the Bosphorus on the twenty-fifth day
of May. Lamartine, his wife and friends
now took up their residence at Buyukdéré,
for the next two months. During
this period they were recipients of the
most friendly attentions. The Grand
Seigneur himself, and the principal officials
at Constantinople extended courtesies
and cordial demonstrations, exceeding
any that had ever before been
bestowed to “Franks.” This was in
recognition of the substantial help
which had been given to prevent the
further dismemberment of the Ottoman
empire. Lamartine had been heralded
everywhere as a personage of distinction,
and his reception was warm and cordial,
almost as if he had been a royal prince.
His opinions were treasured, and his
advice eagerly sought by the ministers
and representatives of the Government.
He was admitted to places from which
other Europeans had been excluded, and
so long as he remained in Turkish territory,
every necessary provision was
made for his safety and honorable recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>His journal of the voyage records
minutely the occurrences and observations
which thus came within his notice.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

falleth into the pit of his own conceit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To determine the real relations that
exist between man and God is
my thought. It is the need of
the times. We need to convince ourselves
that man is the object of all earthy
resources if we ask ourselves if he is
a means to an end. If man is linked to
all, is there nothing above him to which,
in his turn, he is bound? If he is the
last of the unexplained transformations
which reach up to him, may he not be
the tie between visible and invisible
nature? The action of the world is not
an absurdity; it leads up to an end, and
this object cannot be society constituted
as ours is. There is a terrible gap between
us and the heavens.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reality, we cannot ever enjoy or
always suffer. To gain either paradise
or hell an enormous change must take
place in us; without either place, the
masses can conceive no idea of God at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is not the idea of motion stamped on
the systems of worlds, sufficient to prove
God to us? We busy ourselves very
little about the pretended nothingness
which precedes birth while we fumble in
and ransack the dark gulf that awaits
us, that is, we make God responsible for
our future and we demand from him, no
record of the past. To get out of this
difficulty the soul has been invented,
but it is repugnant to our feelings to
render God obligated for human baseness,
our disillusions, our decline and
fall. How can we admit in ourselves a
divine principle over which a potent
liquor can get the advantage?</p>

<p class='c007'>Can we imagine immaterial faculties
which matter may utterly subjugate
whose exercise a grain of opium can
prevent? Is not the communication of
motion to matter an unexplored abyss
whose difficulties have been rather displaced
than resolved by Newton’s system?
Motion is a <i>great soul</i> whose
alliance with matter is quite as difficult
to explain as is the production of thought
in man.—<span class='sc'>Balzac</span>, <i>Louis Lambert</i>. (Translated

  <h2 id='cell' class='c003' title='The Human Cell.'>THE HUMAN CELL. <br /> BY ARTHUR A. BEALE, M. B.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>“To demonstrate that Brotherhood
is a fact in Nature; to investigate
the laws of Nature and the
divine powers in Man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When we fall away from the path of
duty, when torn by the storms of passion
we forget that there reposes within
the complexities of our nature a divine
spark—much more, perhaps, that we
ourselves are a universe, nay, a universe
of Universes, a Great Eternal God, controlling,
energizing and creating worlds
that live and have their day and cease to
be. But it is so. Hour by hour worlds
are falling away and with them ebb the
vital forces of our being. Take a flake
of scurf from the head and put it under
the microscope,—a new vista is opened
up. And yet, this is only a type of millions
of like or dissimilar entities, which
are so bound together as to compose the
mighty universe of man’s body,—the
least important of his constitution.
These little lives take different shapes
to suit different necessities, but they
agree in certain essential features which
we learn to call <i>the cell</i>. And looking
lower still this cell is of the same type as
those found in the animals and again in
the plants. How very little difference,
too, between these and the monads of
the mineral kingdom!</p>

<p class='c007'>But keeping to man, these cells form
themselves into societies, which we call
tissues, these into others we call organs,
and the organs form together a corporate
organization, the body, which in a
healthy state is subservient to the synthesizing
forces emanating from the
Heart, where lives the source of life, the
divine Ruler. So the organs work together
in harmony. If any organ begins
to absorb more attention and life than is
due to it, not only does it suffer itself,
but brings discord into the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as long as it observes its own duty
and fulfils its place, so does it maintain
its own status, and receive its own benefits;
for thus, and thus alone, can it
participate in the higher impulse, that
comes from that sacred centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>As of the organs so of the cells of
which each is composed, they must act in
accordance with the unified impulse of
the organ, but so must each cell be true
to the heart of its own tiny body—whence,
as I shall try to show, comes
the true impulse, by which it evolves,—that
centre where are played the divine
harmonies and where stands the God
directing his forces in the building of
“the temple not made with hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a Universal Activity. It is the
same process going on through all the
kingdoms of the Universe, from the tiny
crystals to plants, from plants to animals,
and animals to man.</p>

<p class='c007'>But specializing the cell we note
not only that all the body is composed
of cells or the deposit of cells, but that
one type of cells develops from another
type, and ultimately all cells result from
one single cell “into which,” in the
words of Darwin, “life was breathed by
the Creator”—of course always understanding
that we have not specified the
nature of the Creator.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this is so, and no one in these times
will dare to dispute it, it begins to dawn
upon us that this curious complex body
of man is, as it were, a tremendous society
of entities, the separate individualities
of which, whilst retaining their
place as such in the great body, are
swamped in the individuality of that one.
Not only so, but as it will be our endeavor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>to show later on, the healthy existence
of each part greatly depends on its maintaining
its loyalty and subservience to
the supreme Chief, from which it gets its
daily source of energy and inspiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is true of the part is true of the
whole and <i>vice versa</i>. For in its turn the
body of man must be subservient to that
of which it is a part, and answer to the
call of that which represents the corporate
body of bodies, and to the divine
light within, “that lighteth every man
that cometh into the world,” which is
one with the Father, the Divine over
soul, of which we are all dim reflections.
So also of the part, the tiny microcosm of
man, the cell, it is in its turn a universe,
a universe so grand that the many revelations
that scientific investigation has
unveiled makes that science stand
aghast; but these, we may venture to
prophesy, are nothing to the occult secrets
that still lie waiting for revelation.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that the magnificent symbolism of
the Gnostics has taught us concerning
The Man Iesous and his relation to Ichthys
the fish, the ark and the ship, can
be well applied to the <i>cell</i>, which is a
veritable Ark with its Holy of holies in
which sit and meditate the holy ones,
the <i>prajapati</i> of the Hindus and the
Christos of the Gnostics. Veritably it is
<i>par excellence</i> the Astral Vehicle, the ship
floating on the watery ocean, veritably
it is the Dagon, the fish-man, the new
teacher coming from the unknown regions
of the Silence, the boat of Vishnu
carrying the God-Man into the world of
Manifestation. We may well exclaim:
O God, how manifest are thy works!
how sublime are thy powers! And when
we contemplate the tiny vehicle of life
under the microscope we may well close-to
the doors of the senses, take off the
sandals and worship, for are we not at
the very altar of the Temple—the temple
of the Almighty; are we not face to face
with the Creators? He that hath eyes to
see let him see!</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the great contributors to the
Science of the Cell perhaps none has approached
nearer the Holy of Holies—none
so nearly tore aside the Veil of
Isis, as <abbr class='spell'>H. P. B.</abbr> has practically told us,
than Professor Weissmann in his contribution
on the Germ Plasm and the
New Problem of Heredity as handled by
him. Under the guiding hand of this
savant we see the cell in a new light, we
begin to see kingdom within kingdom;
and had he but recognized the other side,
had he but explored the dark side of the
Moon, much more might have been
written, many more mouths might have
gaped and many more sceptics have
smiled. Professor Weissmann however
has found a mare’s nest. He has raised
the devil, but forgotten to give him something
to do, and as of old we cannot
help exclaiming, what next! The cell of
Weissmann like the cell of most other
students, is a tiny ball of protoplasm with
a central nucleus (the Holy of Holies,
Fish Man, etc.) but unlike that of other
writers, instead of containing more differentiated
protoplasm, taking the forms
of meaningless and accidental rods, our
revered professor has discovered a Nest
of Creators. He tells us that the greater
portion of the cell does not in any way
participate in the process of hereditary
transmission. Nay, further still, not
only does he regard the nucleus as the
all important particle but to quote his
own words: “The law that only a certain
part of the nuclear matter is to be
regarded as the hereditary substance appears
to me to receive fresh support from
all the more recent observations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the parts referred to are a series
of minute rod-like structures called <i>chromatin
rods</i> that are very active and
manifest all kinds of changes according
to necessity, especially at that critical
period in the history of a cell called cell-division,
when it is about to propagate
its species by <i>making itself</i> into two
by equal distributions of its substance between
its two selves. For you must
know that when a cell divides (and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>does not refer to human cells alone, but
all vegetable and animal cells from the
simplest to the most complex) the products
are two so-called “daughter cells,”
but they are daughters without a mother.
It is one of the most mystical processes
in existence and contains much secret
knowledge for it contains the mystery
of the birth of two from one. In this
process, called in scientific parlance
<i>Karyokinesis</i>, these little rods play a
most important part, nay, the <i>all-important</i>
part, for the whole process commences
with them and proceeds from the
centre outward. There is at the commencement
of the process a disturbance,
a series of vibrations throughout the
nucleus. These little rods immediately
form into a kind of reticulum or network;
then this network arranges itself
into an indefinite spiral, at which instant
two mysterious bodies issue from the
mass at opposite poles, and take up a
position in the cell, at some distance
from the coil of rods; then the spiral
breaks up into two opposing sets of
loops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ultimately these two sets of rods settle
down in the neighborhood of the two
little bodies (<i>centrosomes</i>) shot out, or, I
should perhaps say, are attracted separately
to the two poles of the cell by the
<i>centrosomes</i>. Then a cell wall forms between;
the one cell becomes two.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some very occult forces at
work behind all this, and they generally
are referred to, to cover our ignorance,
as the law of polarity, albeit that this
law, whatever it is, involves the most
occult of the creative forces, in fact of all
manifestation.</p>

<p class='c007'>To go back, Dr. Weissmann does not
consider these rods which he calls <i>idants</i>
as the essential units, but states that in
their turn these are themselves composed
of more minute bodies he calls <i>ids</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this respect, however, he considers
protoplasm as a whole as composed, not
of so many chemical compounds, having
an indefinite and uncontrollable action
on one another, but of collections of
“molecules united into a single group.”
These molecules he calls <i>biophors</i>. The
biophors, as bearers of vitality, possess
the power of growth and of multiplication
by fission. But the biophors which
go to make up the rods, have a more
specific character of their own, and are
the carriers of those minuter bodies still
which this savant speaks of as the real
creative units, or what he calls “<i>determinants</i>.”
These ultimate determinants,
smaller than microscopic, hold within
their tiny hearts the ideal shape of the
part which they are destined to control,
carried and distributed in the process of
evolution of the creature by the process
of cell division.</p>

<p class='c007'>This conception, enormous advance as
it is on the previous materialism of
Huxley’s protoplasm, is yet so pregnant
with the taint of the materialistic
age, that it requires modifying before it
can even be admitted as a logical hypothesis.
For one must ask; if the cell
gets its impulse from the nucleus, the
nucleus from the rods that inhabit it,
these rods from the little biophors of
which they are composed, and these
from the determinants, where on earth
do the determinants get it from? We
are reminded, moreover, that there was
a time, not far away, when this particular
cell had no separate existence of its
own. And if we are directed back to the
ovaries, and from them to the germinal
layer, and this from the cell again, still
there is no escape, for we may well ask
with the Duke of Argyle: “What then!
Whence the first?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the thing has a more definite and
easy solution, for if these material units
are the Creators, and if as it is stated, the
ingredients of matter, especially sentient
matter (so-called) are constantly undergoing
motion and change, by displacement;
what about these units when the
time comes for them to play their part,
has not their substance been lost and replaced
over and over again.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>So we come back to our philosophy
and we realize what our Chief, W. Q.
Judge, taught us, that the cell only has
an existence as an <i>idea</i>. Thinking of
this word for a moment, looking it up
in the dictionary we find the following
<i>verbatim</i> (Gr. idea, from <i>idein</i>, to see)
“one of the archetypes or patterns of
Created things, conceived by the Platonists
to have existed from eternity in
the mind of the Deity.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Now look
at the words used by Dr. Weissmann,
<i>idants</i> and <i>ids</i>. Is there not something
very suggestive here. We are then
dealing not with matter alone, but with
ideas; nay, more, what is matter but an
idea or congeries of ideas? For as has
been well said we know nothing of matter
<i>per se</i> but only the manifestation of
matter. It is the idea not the matter
that takes form. Now we must surely
recognize that ideas as <i>things</i> are not
causes but effects. So our professor all
this time has been dealing with effects
and gets these mixed up with the causes.
If cells and the contents are ideas containing
ideas, and if idea means that
which is seen, then there must somewhere
be a Seer, and such a seer without
any sophistry must be a magician—not
because we associate the word Seer
with magician, but quite independently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we have realized that the body of
man is composed of many minuter entities,
over which stands the supreme
ruler. Each organ is composed of many
entities, over which rules the conscious
governor of that organ, and so on to the
little cells which in their turn are composed
of minuter creatures each having
a conscious existence of its own, whilst
that Consciousness is composed of the
consciousness of all its component lives.
That consciousness is in each case part
of the Divine consciousness that pervades
all things and acts in direct proportion
to its plane of activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Divine Consciousness in man
which is the real man—real in the sense
of permanency—is quite on a par with
the Creators, though that real self is
perhaps not known to any of our personal
selves. But then stands that real
Self at the commencement of each New
Birth. As the process of evolution goes
on each step in the meditation of this
mighty Self as he contemplates existence,
finds a responsive thrill in the
tiny ovum, bound to himself by the
strong bonds of Karma. As he emerges
in contemplation from the mineral to
the vegetable and on to the animal, so
the sensitive plasm of the germ responds.
Page after page of the history of man is
retold till once more the story is complete
to the point where the previous incarnation
ended; then the child is born
to carry on the history as best he may.</p>

<p class='c007'>So in the cell the determinants are the
little bundles of ideas coming from the
Magician (ourselves) and being instilled
bit by bit into the heart of each of those
groups of molecules and ensouling it, so
the tale is told and this side of manifestation
opens out into the beautiful blossom
of Humanity, moulded also in part
by the parental influences which can
make or mar the impulse as it comes
straight from the Creator’s mind. Make
or mar, and yet how few women think of
the real, sacred and holy duty of parentage.
How hellish the times in which any
dares to point the finger of scorn and
shame at a blessed pregnant woman.
But as we are beginning to understand,
soon shall we be able to reverence them
all as the sacredness of motherhood is
understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>This little picture contains the whole
of our philosophy, and it must be left
more or less to the intuitions of each.
But in closing we can say this much.
The study of the cell teaches that
Brotherhood is a fact in nature. It
teaches that that brotherhood depends
on the harmonious coördinate activity of
many entities, working together united
by the recognition of the one source of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>life and inspiration. It also teaches the
great Divine mystery that hangs about
every new birth, and that the real seat
of that Divinity is in the Hearts of all
Creatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one more lesson that we ought
not to miss. We have seen the magnificent
results of harmonious action which
is always synthetical and finds its highest
expression in Love and Compassion
issuing from the heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the same force becomes
converted into Hate, when once the centrifugal
disintegrating force is set going
and gains the ascendancy, selfish in nature,
self-centred, it cuts away the bonds
that bind man to his fellows; he tries,
but in vain, to carry on an existence of
his own, but he soon finds that he has
no existence, no meaning, no life apart
from the whole. The foolish virgins repent
too late, their light has gone out,
they have no oil of life with which to
kindle their lamps anew. In their own
blind conceit they are lost. Nay, but
look! Have not some demons, spooks
and malignant fiends got hold of them
and, having gained an entrance, are now
without their consent messengers of Disease
and Death. Is this not so of the
cells? Some little impulse causes them
to pursue a course contrary to the interests
of the whole; for a time they are
centres of discord; and neuralgia, rheumatism,
indigestion, etc., are the result.
But anon the cells fall away and, as
entities, die. The smaller containing
entities, the Chromatin rods, little pregnant
particles of life are set free. Losing
their parental protection and cares, they
go on with the impulse given them, till
some malignant breeze sweeps over them
and they become the victims and servants
of hate, disease and Death. Are
these not the germs of disease that
science is fighting about just now?
Verily! verily! who shall deny? These
little escaped convicts, the rods, previously
servants of Love, become now the
free agents of disease. They are none
other than the bacilli, associated with so
many pestilences; and a further disintegration
produces spores—the ingredients
of bacilli. These are not the diseases,
nor yet the cause (primary), they
are merely the vehicles of disease. Can
we not see how well this applies to every
organism and organization as an entity?
Poor lost bacilli, how hardly have ye
been used by your masters!</p>

  <h2 id='sokratic' class='c003' title='The Sokratic Club.'>THE SOKRATIC CLUB. <br /> By SOLON. <br /> (<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>So much interest had been aroused by
the conversation on Art and the
Drama as an Educative Factor
which I have already recorded, that there
was a larger attendance than usual at
the next meeting of the Club. Everyone
was glad to see Madam Purple who it
was known to all had established a
school to revive the ancient wisdom and
to teach the laws of physical, moral and
mental health and of spiritual development
and for the purpose of accentuating
the importance of Music and Drama as
vital educative factors had already reproduced
one of the old Greek Tragedies
in such a way as to arouse the attention
of the public and astonish the critics,
touching a new chord and awakening
new possibilities for the influence of the
stage on the lives and characters of the
people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Roberts had evidently not yet
been convinced of the importance of this
work though he had seen and even
praised the production of Æschylus’
Eumenides, for he still reiterated his old
objections. The discussion so far had
been on general lines, but now it turned
more particularly on the Drama.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“I cannot see how the
performance of Eumenides or any play
you may take from the ancients can
have any such effect that you claim it
will have. The people who attend will
see no more in it than in any other play.
Of course it will have its own characteristics
and no doubt its classical beauty,
but will not these peculiar features appeal
only to the very few? How will
you make it a factor in the education of
the masses?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“I do not think you
understand the real character of the ancient
drama, Doctor. Probably, also
with the exception of the recent production,
you base your ideas of the attractiveness
of Greek Plays upon the presentations
which are occasionally given
at one of the Universities. Classical
these may be in a sense, I admit, but
certainly they are severe.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“How can they help
but be severe. I remember when at college
that one of these plays was acted
by some of the students, but for my part
I saw nothing particular in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mme. Purple.</i>-“Was not that possibly
because those who produced the play
and enacted the parts, themselves saw
nothing in it beyond the mere incident
as told in so many words?</p>

<p class='c007'>“The most beautiful things remain invisible
to those who have not eyes to
see. Look at the hundreds and thousands
in every large city and, strange to say,
more particularly in country districts,
who know nothing of the beauty and
sublimity of the heavens and nature
around them. Many a farmer looks at
the sky simply to note the changes of the
weather. The magnificence of cloud effect,
the glory of the sunrise and the
quivering of the eternal stars, he never
sees. And even those who profess to be
lovers of nature, how little more than
external beauty do they see? Do they
indeed see any deeper than the surface of
things and but rarely pierce the veil to
behold with awe and wonderment the
reality?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“But, Madam Purple,....”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“Ah! Doctor, it is
always, ‘but’. Isn’t it all true, with no
‘but’?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“Yes, I grant you that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>what Madam Purple said about the appreciation
of nature is true, and even
that the same thing applies to the appreciation
of art and music and the drama.
But—I was going to say—it seems to me
your illustration is too lofty for the case
under consideration. It is true one may
rise to the greatest heights of consciousness
under the influence of music and
poetry and the contemplation of high
ideals and if I understand you aright,
Madam Purple, you hold these are the
same high feelings that may be aroused
by the grand harmonies of nature and by
what perhaps is meant by the music of
the spheres. Do I catch your meaning?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“Yes, Doctor, you
have caught the idea in part, but music
and poetry and the harmonies of nature
too often exercise only what I might call
an unconscious and transitory influence—not
deep-seated in any sense—because
men will not open their eyes and lend
their ears. The great anthem of nature
is ever being sung; life is joy and harmony;
but alas, there are so many who
will not open their hearts to the song
and the sunshine. But I see you wish
to say something more, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“Yes, I grant this may
be true, no doubt it is true, but to return
to the old Greek tragedies, although
there may be lofty ideas in them, I fail
to see that they will produce the effect
you anticipate. There is no music in
them and they are altogether too cold
and bare. Besides, what meaning do
they hold, deeper than that which may
be seen by the ordinary reader?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“A meaning that the
mere student of languages and literature
will never find, but one that to the student
of life, to one who recognizes that
there is an inner life, will ever unfold
more and more and reveal such beauties
and harmonies that will thrill the very
soul.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Roberts.</i>—“I do not see it, though
I grant that high moral lessons may be
contained in the old Greek poetry and
tragedies, but at the same time there is
so much that is mere fancy. We have
passed the age of the childhood of the
race when the mythological tales of the
gods and goddesses were seriously taken.
I do not deny that there may be many
valuable lessons in these, but I certainly
think that you are reading into them a
great deal that is not there. Pardon my
frankness, but I really wish to understand
your position.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“It is not a question
of reading a meaning into them, but of
being able to draw the meaning out, and
to do this requires a master-hand. No
modern scholar who is not a mystic will
find it, and it is no wonder it has been
lost to the ordinary reader.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“Doctor, you thought
my illustration of the beauties of nature
too high, but after all the beauties which
we see in nature are but the reflection of
the beauties in the soul, and do not exist
save to him who has developed some
beauty of soul. The old Greek tragedies,
and particularly those of Æschylus, are
portrayals of the life and struggles of
the soul.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then Dr. Wyld came into the
room. He had been present at the performance
of the Play, and had expressed
himself so pleased with it that the Professor
had asked him to visit the Club.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Doctor came over immediately to
where Madam Purple and the Professor
were sitting, and these meetings being
more or less informal, the conversation
was interrupted for the exchange of
greetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Wyld is a very tall, broad-shouldered,
spare man, I should judge about
seventy years old, but carrying his age
gracefully. He is one of the best known
Greek scholars, of a keen and vigorous intellect.
Dignified, yet with a keen appreciation
of humor and fond of a good story
as well as able to tell one. Not only is
he a profound scholar of Greek and Neo-platonic
literature, but of the world’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>literature, ancient and modern. He is at
once a mystic and a keen observer of
men, and had led a very active life, especially
in the literary world, as an author,
and had also written for some of the leading
newspapers of the metropolis. In
this way he had met very many of the
prominent public men, both literary and
political, of the past half-century. It
had been my privilege to spend many a
delightful hour with him and in that
way I have gained a clearer conception
of the history of the United States than
from any reading I have done, and also
of the beauties of the writings of the old
philosophers, especially the Neo-platonists.</p>

<p class='c007'>His tall figure and dignified bearing
would attract attention in any gathering,
and as he entered the room with his long
stride, all eyes were turned towards him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Professor rose to receive him. The
room was beautifully yet simply decorated
with hangings of harmonious colors,
and the Doctor noticed these immediately
and addressing Madam Purple:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“What a pleasure it is to
come into a room where there is such
harmony of tone and color. I can well
understand what the Professor told me
that your meetings here are always delightful.
The very atmosphere seems
conducive to harmony of feeling and the
awakening of high thought.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“That is true, Doctor,
I hold that color ought to be made a very
important factor in life, and that the
harmonies of sound and color are essential
features of true education.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“And I think you have
already struck the key-note of this in
your production of the Eumenides, and
I wish to tell you of the rare treat
it was to me to witness it and the
opportunity it gave me of really judging
what a Greek play is like—such
as could never be gained from
reading. It had all the aroma of ancient
Athens. One of my friends remarked
that it had the beauty of a Greek statue,
but I would go further, for it had also
the grace and beauty of life. I do not
mean that the performance was perfect
but it was the spirit that pervaded it
that gave it this great charm. And after
seeing it I do not wonder in coming here
that you also carry out your ideas of harmony
in the decoration of your Club-room.
It is a further carrying out of
what you teach and which I fully agree
with, that what is most needed in our
educational system and in life generally
is a sense of harmony and of the due
proportion of things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the Rev. Alex. Fulsom, who had
come in a short time before Dr. Wyld,
and had listened more attentively than
usual (without going to sleep) to the
conversation, moved his chair a little
forward as if to speak, but waited a moment.
Although he always expressed
himself as most sensitive to harmonious
shades of color and adored—as he expressed
it—Greek statuary, though he
equally adored a pretty bonnet, nevertheless
did not in any way support
Madam Purple in her revival of the
ancient Drama.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“Well, Alec, what is
it now? Another objection? I’m beginning
to think you belong to some
objection society, whose main purpose
is to object to everything on principle
and for the sake of objecting. Come,
tell us now, haven’t you pledged yourself
to the following:—‘I pledge myself
to always object to everything that may
be proposed by anybody?’ But for once,
Alec, put your objections on one side
and enter into the spirit of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rev. Alex. Fulsom.</i>—“No, Professor,
I am not to be turned aside from my
opinion by any method of badinage or
ratiocination. And what is more, I
think it my duty to express my views.
As I have said before, it appears to me
altogether beneath the dignity of a
Leader and Teacher in such a cause as
ours to be concerned in the production
of a play—whether Greek or not—or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>spend so much time and the energies of
the Club in mere philanthropic work.
The latter, doubtless, is laudable enough
but the Club has other aims to pursue,
and it seems to me to have departed
from its time-honored methods of study.
Indeed, the study of the philosophy
seems to be almost completely overlooked
nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“Having delivered
yourself of your objection, I trust you
feel a little relieved, my friend, but you
have not hit the nail on the head, Alec.
Study is not overlooked, but on the contrary,
our students are learning how to
study and the true value of study as the
precursor of right action. Thanks
to Madam Purple, the study of philosophy
is no longer looked upon as the
end and aim of life. Theoretical study
is good and necessary, but our students
realize that Brotherhood is more than a
theory, that it is an actual fact to be
consciously realized and that they must
seek to make Theosophy a living power
in their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know well the scriptural saying
which I will slightly paraphrase,
‘Let your light so shine before men,
that they seeing your good works will
glorify the higher law and follow it.’ It
behooves us to practice Brotherhood as
well as to profess it. But it is the things
they don’t like that the objectors see but
they fail to see that the study which they
are crying out for is still pursued though
on higher and broader lines than heretofore,
become possible by the advance
made by the whole Movement. The inner
work and the real study have never
ceased but have taken on a deeper meaning.
Thank the gods, instead of the
members seeking to have or to become
special <i>gurus</i> and imagining themselves
better than others, the whole organization
moves along in touch with the life
of the world, all striving ever to put into
practice that which they preach. The
time-honored methods of which you
speak were fast becoming time-honored
ruts and you ought to thank your stars,
that here is an opportunity to get out
of the ruts and enter upon a broader field
of life and activity as well as of study.
And so far as the Play is concerned you
seemed to have missed entirely its purpose
and the wide influence which can
thus be exerted in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rev. Alex. Fulsom.</i>—“There may be
some good in it no doubt, but there are
so many other things that are needed in
the world. I certainly think a teacher
would have a higher work to do. There
are enough philanthropists and elevators
of the drama, whereas our philosophy
is unique, and surely we ought
to carry out the original plans of the
Founder.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“And you assume, I
might say, <i>presume</i>, to know what those
original plans were, but your conception
of them admits of no growth, but only
stagnation or the continuing in ruts
which so many have formed for themselves
through their misconception and
limited knowledge of, if not deliberate
indifference to those plans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I often wondered how it was the Professor
did not lose patience completely
with the Rev. Alec., always so pessimistic,
trying to tear down. But then we all
knew that his moods depended on his
digestion, and upon that subtle disease—the
love of approbation and prominence.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“Mr. Fulsom, do, I
beg of you, try to rise a little above
your pessimistic fears and let a little
of the sunshine of hope and trust come
into your heart. Students of Theosophy
above all others ought to be able to take
a larger grasp of the problems of life and
perceive that the greatest truths which
will ultimately bring the grandest results
and happiness to all mankind must necessarily
be often at first obscured; that
to help the masses we must begin where
they can appreciate the work, and so move
out gradually along the lines of least resistance.
Thus will all those who seek
the Light be attracted and helped, whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>their development. Our grand philosophy
must be presented in various
ways if the many different minds are to
be touched, for you well know that all
men are not built alike—to use a common
expression. Babes need to be fed as well
as strong men. For some the teaching
must be given in parables and there are
some truths that but few can bear to
hear. As for the original plan of the
work, <abbr class='spell'>H. P. B.</abbr>, the great artist, spread
the canvas and sketched the outline with
a bold hand, then the second Helper put
in the colors of the background thus
making clearer the design upon the
trestle board, but do you think you have
been able to see the whole of the grand
design and have grasped the harmonious
proportions of the noble edifice in all
their beauty and grace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then turning her head for a moment
with her wonderful smile, Madam Purple
continued after a short pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Imagine for one moment that when
<abbr class='spell'>H. P. B.</abbr> began her work in the world
she could have shown what is now being
done, or that it could be shown to you
what will be the outcome of her efforts
two hundred years hence, would it not
be entirely beyond belief, can you even
imagine it? There must be a <i>gradual</i>
growth and unfoldment suited to the
comprehension of the people. How then
dare anyone say that the present activities
are contrary to the plan of H. P. B.
Ah! Mr. Fulsom, is not such a position
evidence of retrogression and not of
growth?</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, pardon me, Dr. Wyld, this is
somewhat of a digression from the subject
of the Greek play which you were
discussing. Let us come back in thought
to the old Greek Drama. There, at least,
the gods wait for us and call to us to
rise above this <abbr title='nineteenth'>XIXth</abbr> Century materialism
into the realm of the beautiful, the
ideal and the true.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“An almost unknown land
to so many, but I hail with joy the prospects
that once more the geography of
that celestial country shall form part of
the education of the race and lead us
further back in the history of humanity
into that greater and more ancient land
of the pyramids and the silent sphinx.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“And from there further
back still to prehistoric America,
which was in the early days the ancient
Land of Light when Egypt was yet
young and whence Egypt derived her
wisdom and her science.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“That is indeed interesting,
though to me it is not difficult to
believe. It opens out a new chapter in
the life of humanity and I doubt not that
if it can be shown to be so, it will solve
many problems in the history of man’s
development. But will you not tell us
further on this subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“Time would not permit
of going into it at any length, Doctor,
but I will say this. Time will bring
the proof of what I say. Archæological
research started at the right time, which
is not far distant, in this country and in
Central America will supply clear evidence
of the truth of this statement.”
She paused a moment, then continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends, with all these grand possibilities
in view, when such momentous
questions are involved that will bring
such priceless knowledge to the human
race, can you wonder that the real
workers find time all too precious to be
frittered away in useless argument. It
is work, work, work, that our glorious
cause demands of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madam Purple spoke with so much
earnestness, that it stirred one’s heart
to its very depths, old memories of the
long forgotten past seemed about to
awaken, pictures of the ancient times
flitted across the vision, and of the future
when the glories of the past should be
revived. One young lady of slight
figure and pale face, an enthusiastic
worker, always present at the meetings,
but who never ventured to say a word,
now exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The very thought of it brings new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>life, new hope. Surely we haven’t any
time to sit and mope over the little frictions
that beset our paths. Surely we
should keep on working and trusting
that we may be a part of this new life
and each of us become individually a
hope and a light to those who would
walk this broad path of knowledge towards
the glorious future that awaits
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“One can see even now
indications that the world is advancing
to a broader field of thought. The revival
of the ancient drama and the way
the ‘Eumenides’ was received show
this clearly and show that the links with
the mighty past exist in the hearts of
men—albeit unconsciously to most, but
ready to be awakened into responsive
action when again the picture of that
long forgotten life is presented before
them. I heard with much interest
that in one city where the play was
given, the notices of the performance
were given out in almost every church
in the city. And one prominent minister
said it was the finest study of conscience
scourging for sin and of the
Divine Power to pardon and transform,
he ever saw. He said such plays are
better than sermons.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“It is indeed gratifying
that there are so many interested
in almost every line of work that will
benefit humanity and who are naturally
drawn to help along educative lines.
All work to be of real benefit must be
educative.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“Let me go back to what
I said just after I came into the room, it
comes upon me with greater and greater
force, and I felt it too while watching
the performance that somehow it moved
one right away from this grasping,
money-making world to a new-old world
near to the silence and peace of things
where words are not needed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“May it not be that
by taking up this Drama in the right
spirit and reviving the ancient life and
consciousness by going back in thought
to old Athens, we have started anew the
vibrations which resulted in the beauty
of Greek art and life. Then here in the
Club where but rarely any discordant
note arises, but where we come together
in harmony there comes an indescribable
something that leaves its impress on the
heart, of peace and joy and at the same
time a sense of courage and unconquerable
energy to carry on this work that our
beloved <abbr class='spell'>H. P. B.</abbr> and the Chief began.
This is a peculiar time at the end of the
century, of such vast importance that is
scarcely realized by any.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“It has been a century
of unrest, and nothing is more needed
than that this keynote of harmony
should be struck at this time, it is in
this that lies the hope of the future, and
it is in this spirit of harmony that actuates
the workers to-day that lies the
guarantee that the work will be carried
into the next century, though one here
and there, unable to go forward in the
new age, must be left behind.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dr. Wyld.</i>—“Madam Purple, will you
not tell us more about Æschylus’ purpose
in writing his plays, for, like Shakespeare’s,
I would declare them to be ‘not
of an age, but for all time.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“Yes, I think Æschylus
and Shakespeare may well be
compared, for each taught the truths of
life, though each veiled them in forms
suited to the times in which they wrote.
It is perfectly evident to the deep student
that there is an inner meaning to
the plays of Æschylus, and it may be
that in his earnestness and endeavor to
instruct the people and bring out these
truths he became so enthused that he introduced
some features of the Inner Mysteries,
and although these could only be
recognized and interpreted by Initiates,
yet the story is he was condemned to
death for this. It is true the inner
meaning had to be clothed in a form
adapted to the tastes of the people. In
those days Greece had begun to retrograde,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>and the true idea of religion
had become obscured in the minds of
the masses. It had begun to take on a
gruesome aspect, and that which had
the greatest hold upon them was fear
and the dread of punishment.  Æschylus,
like all great teachers, adapted his
teachings to the mind of his hearers.
Instead of taking them so high
that they could find no foothold, he
used their ordinary conception of religion
and took them forward one step
at a time. To have brought out the
teaching in all its power and grandeur
would perhaps have dazzled them, and
being beyond their grasp would have
seemed to them to be a tearing down of
their present conceptions and ideals, and
thus have thrown them back and into
rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Professor.</i>—“There are plenty of
evidences of this in modern life, of
would-be teachers who, ignorant of the
laws of growth and development, seek
to tear down and at the same time to dazzle
their hearers with knowledge which
they themselves have not half-digested,
and instead of bringing light and freedom,
they but imprison and fetter the
mind more closely. It is just as though
to hasten the growth of a tender plant a
gardener would bring it out of a cool
and shady spot into the full glare of the
sun. Its life would be burned out by
that which is the very source of its life.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Madam Purple.</i>—“But in Æschylus
the teaching is there, though veiled. The
wise teacher does not tear down until a
new foothold has been found. He builds,
constructs and educates, thus slowly
leading to a higher level, disengaging
the minds gradually from error by instilling
a higher conception of truth. The
inner teaching runs through it all like a
golden thread in a many colored tapestry,
now appearing, now apparently lost, but
in reality only hidden from the casual
observer yet present still to him who has
eyes to see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great effort was made by the Initiates
at about the time of Æschylus to
revive in the heart of the Greeks a love
for the ancient wisdom which they had
received originally from Egypt. Æschylus
himself had been instructed by
teachers not known to the world and had
been prepared to take part in this work
long before he appeared openly as a
teacher and a writer. Those who had
the best interests of the people at heart
and who were ‘called’ to serve as spiritual
teachers were ever seeking to educate
them not according to what the
people demanded of them but according
to their needs. Among these was Æschylus.
He made no great claims for himself
but was a stranger to fear, and so
deeply was he imbued with the love of
humanity and his desire to serve it that
he became indifferent to criticism, and
dared to step out into the arena of life
with a boldness that to those who see
only through the small glasses of vanity
and ambition and who could not understand
him, may have seemed egotism.
But those who can follow the inner
meaning of his writings and can see his
great purpose, recognize him as a true
servant and lover of humanity. What
cared he for the hatred and opposition of
those who loved personal power and
sought to keep the people in ignorance,
who saw that his grand work for helping
humanity would thwart their designs and
block their selfish paths. It was these
who persecuted him and caused him to
be condemned—not his fellow-initiates
and comrades or those who truly loved
wisdom and freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The chief of the persecutors of Æschylus
was one who had the ambition to
hold the place that he had in the hearts
of the people and not succeeding in
this sought to destroy him. Yet in
spite of his many trials and persecutions
his works and memory still live as a
monument to his aspirations and noble
efforts. Yet even to-day he is only
partly understood and like many other
teachers will have to wait for the revolutions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>of the times and the further evolution
of man before the grander meaning
of his great work is made manifest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it has ever been so in the history
of man. History but repeated herself in
the case of Æschylus, in the case of <abbr class='spell'>H.
P. B.</abbr> and many another. Those who
would help humanity know of a surety
what to expect, yet they falter not, nay,
they even gain new courage and endurance
under the persecution, for is there
not in their hearts the Light of Truth
and the love of all true comrades of the
Ages to cheer their path? The devotion
of one faithful heart outweighs in the
balance a multitude of persecutors.”</p>

  <h2 id='students' class='c003' title='Students&#39; Column.'>STUDENTS’ COLUMN. <br /> THE BASIS OF ETHICS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the December number of <span class='sc'>Universal
Brotherhood</span> the question is
asked: “Whence arises the sense of
duty? In what does it originate?”
The answers given are good; and <abbr class='spell'>V. F.</abbr>
touches the key-note in the words “he
owes it to <i>himself</i>,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question and the discussions recalled
to my mind the answer given to
the same question by Dr. Hickok of
Union College in his treatise on Moral
Science, which was published in 1853,
and used as a text-book in the University
of Vermont a few years later.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is too often taken for granted that
a Christian must find a new basis of
ethics and a new rule of right in order
to justify his acceptance of the Theosophical
teachings. This is far from the
case, even assuming for the sake of the
argument what is not true in fact, that
theosophy rejects the Bible; for the great
majority of Christian writers on this
subject have not founded their systems
on the Bible, or upon any religious system
whatever, but have, so far as they
discuss religious duties, treated them as
a part of some greater ethical whole.
Such is the case in the manual of Dr.
Hickok. He only needs to bring out
more clearly the unity of finite spirits
in Absolute Spirit, and to note the proper
distinction between personality and individuality
and between individuality and
the One Life—a distinction that is logical
rather than metaphysical—and to
enlarge his view so as to include the
tenet of reincarnation with its correlative
doctrines, to make his system very
good Theosophy. His foundation is impregnable;
but by overlooking the unity
of the finite in the infinite, and by clinging
to the notion of a personal God distinct
from the Higher Self, he brings
that God into judgment before the finite
spirit of man. This makes the Second
Part of his treatise, on Divine Government,
weak and halting in comparison
with the First Part, on Pure Morality.
His work would have been simplified
and strengthened beyond measure could
he have seen that the self before whom
man stands in the inner sanctuary of
his being is the Higher Self of our teachings,
and is one with the highest Deity.
I quote Dr. Hickok’s statement of the
basis of ethics and of the source of our
sense of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether absolute or finite spirit,
there is to each an inner world of conscious
prerogative—revealed to itself
completely, and to itself only, except as
the absolute includes the finite—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>from which comes forth perpetually the
imperative, that every action be restrained
by that which is due to its own
dignity. It is this consciousness of the
intrinsic excellency of spiritual being,
which awakens the reverence that every
man is forced to feel when he is brought
fairly to stand alone in the presence of
his own spirit. As if another and a
divine self scanned and judged every
purpose and thought of the acting self,
so is every man when arraigned before
his own personality, and made to hear
with uncovered head his sentence of
self-justification or self-condemnation.
There is an awful sanctuary in every
immortal spirit, and man needs nothing
more than to exclude all else, and stand
alone before himself, to be made conscious
of an authority he can neither dethrone
nor delude. From its approbation
comes self-respect; from its disapprobation,
self-contempt. A stern behest is
ever upon him, that he do nothing to
degrade the real dignity of his spiritual
being. He is a law to himself, and has
both the judge and executioner within
him and inseparable from him. The
claim of this intrinsic excellency of spiritual
being, as apprehended by the reason
may be known as the <i>objective</i> Rule
of right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may call this the imperative of
reason, the constraint of conscience, or
the voice of God within him; but by
whatever terms expressed, the real meaning
will be, that every man has consciously
the bond upon him <i>to do that,
and that only, which is due to his spiritual
excellency</i>. The motive to this is not
any gratification of a want, not any satisfying
of a craving, and thus to be done
for a price in happiness; but it is solely
that he may <i>be</i> just what the intrinsic
excellency of his own spirit demands
that he <i>should be</i>. Enough for him, that
he <i>is</i>, in the sight of his own spirit, and
of all spirits, worthy of spiritual approbation.
Not only would he not sell this
worthiness of character for any price,
but he has not attained it for the sake of
a reward beyond it. That it was not the
end, but a means to a further end, would
make it wholly mercenary, and the very
worthiness he speaks of would be profaned
to a marketable commodity. He
willingly then would be anything else
if he could get equal wages for it. To
be thus worthy of spiritual approbation
is the attainment of the highest dignity,
and may be called the <i>subjective</i> end of
ethics, and is a <i>moral good</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the ultimate end of rational
being; the end of all ends. As worthy
of happiness, this may now righteously
be <i>given</i>, and righteously <i>taken</i>, but not
righteously <i>paid</i> as a price nor <i>claimed</i>
as wages. The <i>good</i> is the <i>being worthy</i>,
not that he is to get something for it.
The highest good—the SUMMUM BONUM—is
<i>worthiness of spiritual approbation</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The italics and capitals are Dr. Hickok’s.
“As if another and a divine self
scanned and judged every purpose and
thought of the acting self,” could hardly
be improved by any of our theosophical
writers.</p>

<h3 id='weston' class='c012'>THE WESTON TEN. <br /> BY MARGARET S. LLOYD. <br /> I. STILL POOL.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Weston, Massachusetts, is a
beautiful little New England
town, with the cheerful, home-like
air that is almost always found in
the villages of that State. It is situated
in a pleasant, green valley, surrounded
by hills, and one can see the mountains
of New Hampshire and Vermont from
the main street of the village. The Connecticut
River flows past the western
part of the town and there are many
pleasant walks in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The children of Weston, and there are
many children in this pretty village,
love best to go down to the river, or else
to take the long walk to Quan Glen.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the long main street of
the village, with its rows of comfortable-looking
big white houses, and double
row of elm trees, a turn to the north
brings one, after a half-hour’s walk, to
Quan Glen. It is a lovely little place,
always green even in the severe winter,
for it is sheltered on either side by high
banks of pine, birch, and other trees,
that on the north side of the Glen lead
away into deep woods. The bottom of
the Glen is covered with a soft carpet of
mosses and ferns, and through the middle
runs a clear stream of water, which
makes a pleasant murmur as it ripples
and plashes over the white pebbles
which compose its bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on a hot day in August when a
party of children came through the
woods and prepared to descend the high
bank leading down to the Glen. Out of
the hot sunshine and into the cool green
of the shade trees made a delightful
change after their long walk, and they
pushed forward through the branches
and tall grass and ferns. There were
ten children, four boys and six girls.
The eldest of the children was Phœbe
Allen, a tall, slender girl of fourteen
who seemed to be a sort of little queen
among the others, as they were constantly
appealing to her and running up
to show some new flower or especially
nice fern they had found. Tommy Jones
was the youngest member of the party.
He was seven years old and still wore
the queer over-all blue checked apron
which little boys and girls alike wore at
this period, thirty years ago. The apron
made a splendid play-dress and was
really very comfortable, although our
friend Tommy was a quaint-looking little
figure as he trotted along, the ruffle
of his apron forming a big collar around
his neck, from which his head stood out
like some new kind of a daisy—a daisy
with bright yellow hair and dreamy
grey eyes!</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy was jolly and full of fun and
laughter, but he had his periods of being
quiet and this afternoon was one of
them. At such times his playmates had
learned to leave him alone. For they
knew it was just one of “Tommy’s
silent times,” and that by and by he
would be as merry as the others. He
went along with the other children, holding
Phœbe’s hand and keeping close to
her until they reached the bottom of the
glen. Then the others scattered, leaving
him and Phœbe to walk on together.
The other boys amused themselves by
throwing pebbles in the brook and trying
to find a minnow, while the little
girls wandered about the glen in search
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>of flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe Allen walked slowly along with
Tommy at her side, and after a few minutes
she said: “I’m ever so glad we
came to the glen to-day. It’s just lovely
here isn’t it, little Tommy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I guess ’tis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He continued, “Phœbe, don’t you
like the summer time the best of all?
The woods are so cool and green and
there’s so many flowers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I do love it. But I think I
like the spring time best because I think
the little flowers, so pale and tender, are
the very dearest of all. The summer
flowers are so strong and bright. I love
the little spring flowers the best, and
best of all the big, beautiful purple
violet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy thought a while and then he
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know. I guess you mean that we
love the things that aren’t strong the
best. It wouldn’t hurt a daisy or a big
mullein or a clover blossom one bit if it
was to rain hard. Would it? But the
wee spring flowers couldn’t stand so
much, could they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that’s it. Then, you see, I always
think all the flowers are real people,
just as real as you and I are, only
different, and of all the Flower People—I
always call them the Flower People
when I think of them—it seems to me
that the spring Flower People are the
loveliest. For they come to us almost
before the winter’s gone and while it is
still very cold and we haven’t any other
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think so too,” said Tommy. “You
always ’splain to us children and tell us
lots of nice things to think about,
Phœbe. But I like it best of all when
you ’splain things to just me, for then I
can understand real easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The children soon came to a big chestnut
tree and Phœbe sat down under it
to rest awhile. Tommy walked on.
Phœbe looked around her. She could
hear the children laughing and chattering
up the glen. She watched Tommy.
He walked along, stopping every now
and then to watch a butterfly or to peer
into the waters of the brook as it rippled
along the side of his path.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe sat quiet for some time. The
voices of the other children sounded
farther away until they scarcely reached
her. She saw Tommy’s little figure far
down the glen, beside the Still Pool. “I
wonder what he is looking at,” she
thought, “he has been standing beside
the pool such a long time.” She called,
“Tommy, Tommy,” but he did not turn
his head. She waited a moment and
then started toward him. As she came
near him she saw that he was gazing
into the waters of Still Pool as though
he saw something very wonderful in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still Pool was a beautiful little well of
water at the northern end of the glen. It
was formed by water from the brook
which had some time gone out of its
course and left here this deep, clear pool,
all surrounded by ferns and water cress.
It was almost always so clear that you
could look right down to the bottom of
it and see the white pebbles there. The
children had always called it the
“Still” pool, because it seemed so very
quiet in this part of the glen and the
pool was the stillest of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe came up to Tommy. He did
not hear her; he was looking into the
pool. So she came behind him very
softly and laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you looking at, little
Tommy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have called and called you, but
you never turned your head. I don’t
believe you even saw me as I came up
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy turned around and looked at
her. His big, dreamy eyes looked up
into her soft brown ones. “Oh,
Phœbe,” he said, “I suppose I must
have been dreaming. I’m hardly awake
yet. I saw something so wonderful in
Still Pool.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>Phœbe looked at the child with deep
interest. “You saw a beautiful Face
there, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy looked at her with astonishment.
“Why, how did you know?
Then I must really, truly have seen the
Face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe laid her cool hand on his hot
forehead and brushed his hair back.
Then she took his hand and said softly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come to my chestnut tree before the
other children come back and you
can tell me all about it. Or, if you
don’t feel like talking, we will just rest
under the tree awhile, and when the
others come we will all go home together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy grasped Phœbe’s hand tightly
and walked along. Neither said anything
until they had sat under the tree
for some time. Tommy’s eyes still wore
their far-away look. He laid his head
on Phœbe’s lap, and the young girl
stroked his yellow hair and waited until
he should be ready to talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the little boy sat up and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw a very queer thing while I was
at Still Pool. I was just looking into
the water and thinking how white the
pebbles were, when all at once I couldn’t
see the pebbles any more. The water
looked all gray, and then, while I was
looking and wondering, I saw a beautiful,
beautiful face! I really did, Phœbe,
honest and true!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe looked at the earnest little boy.
She answered nothing, but her face was
transformed as she listened to his story.
Her beautiful brown eyes grew more
gentle looking and her face seemed to
have a light shining behind it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Honest, Phœbe, I did see a beautiful,
lovely face. A <i>real</i> face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure you did, Tommy,” said
Phœbe. She saw that the child was
ready to cry at his fear that perhaps
Phœbe did not understand him. “I
know you saw the Face. I have seen
such a beautiful Face more than once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy drew a deep breath. “It was
the loveliest face you could think about.
It was just shiny, and it had deep, deep
kind eyes, and it looked right up at me
and smiled. Oh, I felt my heart grow
big all at once, and I was just as still as
could be for fear the beautiful thing
would go away. But the first thing I
knew you laid your hand on my shoulder
and I sort of felt as if I was just
waking up. But I know the face was
real and true!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it was, Tommy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It makes a little boy feel very
strange to have such things happen,”
continued Tommy. “But it’s just like
my very own thoughts. Sometimes I
think and think and think until the air
seems all shiny, and then I feel oh, so
happy! So very, very happy! But I
never can make it into words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, dearie, you can’t make it into
words now, but you will be able to some
day. Do you know what I think? I think
that nature made you a Poet when you
were born, and so, as you grow, the beautiful
thoughts will grow and grow as
you do, until some time, when you are a
big man, you will be able to tell all that
you have thought about, all the lovely
dreams, if you call them dreams, that
you ever have had, and all these lovely
shining things will grow into beautiful
words and be printed in books. Then
they will be read by men and women and
little boys and girls, too, and it will help
them all to be good and more happy than
they ever were before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy gazed with loving, wondering
eyes while Phœbe spoke. He felt as
though he understood all she meant as
he watched her face. For while she
talked it absolutely shone and she looked
as though she saw, far in the distance,
little Tommy, grown to be a man and a
wonderful poet.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a while Tommy said, suddenly:
“Oh, Phœbe, I know what the lovely
face in the pool was!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, dearie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you remember the other day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>when all us children were in your house
and you were telling us those nice stories?
Don’t you remember how you
told us there was a shining boy or girl
in each one of us? I remember all you
told us about it and you said it was the
real, true self. Our own best self; our
bestest goodie. I believe the face in the
pool was my bestest goodie; it must
have been!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps it was, Tommy. But why
do you say ‘bestest goodie’?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“'Cause ‘bestest’ is the very, <i>very</i>
best, and ‘goodie’ is the very nicest,
<i>goodest</i> thing. So ‘bestest goodie’ is the
very loveliest thing of all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the Shining One is all that,
dearie. You have found a very good
name for it. Our Shining Self is our
‘Bestest Goodie.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon the other children came up to
Phœbe and Tommy and the party started
for home. All the boys and girls had
bunches of ferns and flowers and the
boys whistled as they walked. The little
girls walked along more sedately, all of
them clustering around Phœbe who
laughed and chatted with them, as gay
as the gayest. Tommy, too, was full of
fun, as he hopped along, holding on to
Phœbe’s hand. All the quiet, sober
thought was put aside, and again they
were just two happy children with the
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the party reached the main street
of Weston once more, it was decided,
before breaking up, that the ten children—the
Weston Ten, as they call themselves—should
meet in Phœbe’s house
to spend the afternoon two days from
that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Universal Brotherhood Meetings, held Sunday evenings in the Aryan Hall,
are increasing in interest all the time. A noticeable feature is the number of
men who attend and the very excellent and intelligent questions which are
asked. The meetings are interspersed with music, usually by the Misses Fuller,
Piano and Violin, forming a very important part of the proceedings. Short addresses
are given and questions answered by H. T. Patterson, H. Coryn, B.
Harding, and J. H. Fussell. A collection is also taken to help defray expenses
and it is found that the visitors appreciate the opportunity of doing this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Aryan Lodge Meetings on Tuesday evening have for some time past been
for members only but it has been decided to open them to the public. The first
open meeting was held Jan. 17, and a number of visitors were present. The Lodge
meetings adjourn at 9.30, thus giving an opportunity for conversation and social intercourse.
Our President, Bro. Neresheimer, often adds to the pleasure of the evening
by singing.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new Lodge was formed in New York on the West Side on Jan. 3. At the time
of writing three meetings have so far been held. A large room with a piano has
been hired at 587 Hudson Street, and a very good beginning has been made, several
people being already interested. This is one of the old residence districts of
New York and the inhabitants generally are noted for being good thinkers and
earnest people. Those helping in the work are members from the H. P. B. and
Aryan Lodges: D. N. Dunlop, S. Hecht, Mrs. Cracauer, Dr. Wilcox, Miss Bernstein,
H. T. Patterson, H. Coryn, Miss Whitney, J. H. Fussell, and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bro. Albert E. S. Smythe is now making a tour of Universal Brotherhood
Lodges and is a fully authorized representative of the Universal Brotherhood, and the
International Brotherhood League. He has so far visited Toledo, Fort Wayne and
Chicago and has had good success. This is an opportunity for the new members
and those at a distance to come in closer touch through Bro. Smythe with the
work at Headquarters. Bro. Smythe is so well known through his work in Toronto
and as Editor of <i>The Lamp</i> and so many have also heard him at the annual Conventions
of the T. S. A. that he needs no introduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inquiries have been received in regard to the railway arrangements for the Congress
of Universal Brotherhood at Point Loma next April. Bro. W. A. Stevens,
500 Lafayette Ave., Buffalo, N. Y., has these in charge and will be ready to report
by about Feb. 1st. Those desiring information should write him. Further particulars
will be given in <i>The New Century</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important meeting of the Universal Brotherhood was held in Boston, Jan.
17, at which were present the Leader, E. A. Neresheimer, F. M. Pierce, H. T. Patterson,
and H. Coryn from New York, and Clark Thurston from Providence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>January 13th was the
1st anniversary of the founding
of the Universal Brotherhood
Organization. The
second year of <abbr class='spell'>U. B.</abbr> has begun
and we can now look
back and see how great a
work has been done during
the past year. But more
than all, one may know
what this work has been,
by simply looking into his
own heart. It has been a
year of great effort; of trial
to some; but has resulted
in joy to all who have
worked unselfishly in our
glorious cause and who
have followed faithfully the
guidance of our great Leader.
I have heard many
say recently that it seemed
as though a new spring had
begun, that they felt so
happy they wanted to sing.
There does indeed seem to
be a new energy awakening
and certainly never before has there been such a happy harmonious household
and staff as at present at Headquarters, nor have we ever had such bright and
harmonious meetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this is not only true of New York and the Headquarters but of the whole
organization from Boston and the East, from Fort Wayne, Chicago, Pittsburg,
Macon, and Lodges too numerous to mention, from the whole Pacific Coast and the
North West come the same tidings of new hope, new strength, new achievements.
Truly, U.B. 2 has begun auspiciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secretary’s Annual Report for Year Ending December 21, 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Officers and Members of Universal Brotherhood Lodge No. 7, America.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Comrades</span>:—Your secretary begs leave to report as follows concerning the closing
year:</p>

<p class='c007'>The year’s work shows a gratifying increase in results. In order to be exact
your secretary gives the figures as shown by the minutes of the year: 547 meetings
were held, with an attendance of 41,150, as against 478 meetings and 36,279 attendance
in 1897, an increase of 14 per cent. in the number of meetings and of 13-1/2 per
cent. in attendance; 481 addresses were delivered at these meetings by 65 speakers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The highest total weekly attendance was 1060; the lowest 605; average 791.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most noticeable increase is in the case of the International Brotherhood
League, which began the year with an average attendance of 78, and closes the
twelve-month with an average attendance of 170, a gain of 118 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lotus Group shows a gain of 18 per cent., as compared with 1897, and Lodge
meetings a gain of 29 per cent. The attendance of visitors at the Library increased
16 per cent., and of members at meetings of Pacific Coast Committee for Universal
Brotherhood 98 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The especial attention of members is called to the Ethical Class and Secret Doctrine
Class as being the most important local channels for the acquirement of a
knowledge of ethics and philosophy. The Ethical Class shows a gain of 35 per
cent., and the Secret Doctrine Class 33 per cent. for the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work at San Quentin Penitentiary was resumed in August, under the direction
of H. H. Somers, after a suspension of more than a year. Lectures are given
monthly, and the chapel is always filled with listeners.</p>

<p class='c007'>A private meeting of <abbr class='spell'>U. B. L.</abbr> No. 7 was instituted in October, two meetings
being held each month. Beginning with January this meeting will be held regularly
every Thursday evening, and is expected to accomplish much good by way of
bringing members into closer sympathy with each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your secretary’s annual report one year ago showed that 1897 had been the most
prosperous year in the history of the movement in this city. By the present report
it is seen that 1898 far surpasses the previous year, and this in the face of financial
distress and general unrest. The prediction is ventured that 1899 will bring a still
greater need of success, for it is the beginning of a California cycle. In 1849 the
name of California was emblazoned before the world. The closing year marks the
passing of the seventh septenate of the cycle, and 1899 will usher in the new cycle
which is to bring California again before the notice of the world, but this time as
the depository of spiritual gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>This report would be incomplete without reference to the Chicago Convention,
held on February 18, 1898, at which time the Universal Brotherhood, or the Brotherhood
of Humanity, was promulgated under the leadership of Mrs. Katherine
A. Tingley, and of which the Theosophical Society in America and the International
Brotherhood League became integral parts. San Francisco Branch at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>transformed itself into a Lodge of Universal Brotherhood, becoming Lodge 7—the
mystic number—and the results of the year are ample justification of the action
taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a few defections from the Society because of its expansion, but the
record shows that the result was in no wise serious for the organization. An
organization, like a human body, is made up of atoms or lives, and as growth proceeds
these atoms are constantly changing their position and passing into and out
of the body. The correspondence is very similar, except that in the case of this
organization it is not the law of fatality which expels the atoms, but each has the
free will to maintain his position in the growing body if he so desires, or to leave it.
Each will choose as he desires, and we have not the right to attempt to compel
them. We have but to perform our full duty in every department of our lives, and
the recorders of karma will adjust the conditions and the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>I congratulate the members of Universal Brotherhood Lodge No. 7 on the work
of the closing year and the prospects of the coming one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fraternally,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Amos J. Johnson</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>San Francisco</span>, December 21, 1898.</p>
<p class='c006'>LOTUS HOME.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Buffalo, N. Y.</span>, Dec. 29, 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Leader</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish it were in my power to express to you all the sweetness and quiet joy
of the first Christmas, at Lotus Home, and the only thing that was lacking, was
the presence (in the physical body) of the precious “Lotus Mother,” for it was
such a delightful experience, so full of hope and promise, that we wanted you there
to share it with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Truly the spirit of “Peace on Earth, Good Will to all Men” brooded over the
Home and spread its wings over all that are working and ministering to the tiny
“Buds” there.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is wonderful to see the improvement in them as the days go on, since Dr.
Kean has taken them in hand; she understands all their little needs and with Miss
Morris’ gentle and unceasing care and attention they are growing as strong and
beautiful as the most exacting could desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The atmosphere surrounding them is so serene and full of unselfish brotherly
love that the unfoldment into health and beauty of mind and body has begun
early, and we feel sure that they will grow to lovely “Blossoms by and bye” and
be workers for Humanity on the broadest lines of “Universal Brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the Christmas Tree, filled with lights and all the “shining things,”
and the sweet odor of the fragrant boughs filled the rooms, the babies and all the
household gathered around it with the members of our family also, at twilight,
and if any one thinks a lot of wee babies do not enjoy the fun of a Christmas tree,
let them come here and see “ours,” they stared and laughed and took in all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>loveliness, as wisely as the older ones of us. Little Katherine was so overcome
with prolonged staring and nodding her head with approval, that she fell asleep in
the midst of it, no doubt continuing the lovely vision in her dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Grace with the rosy cheeks and laughing blue eyes had grown to the
dignity of short clothes on Christmas day, and though but five months old she
sat in her fine new high chair and crowed and laughed aloud with glee just as
though she were years old instead of months only.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wee Edith, our frailest Bud, is frail no longer, but is growing stronger and rosier
every day, and her great wonderful eyes look as if they held a store of untold
things, which she will give to the world some day, in song or verse.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Christmas Eve a new-comer appeared, little “merry Christmas” and on
Christmas day another; this one we didn’t know what to call for the time being,
but little “Miss Newcome,” and that made six small workers for humanity at
Lotus Home on Christmas day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The household is now composed of twelve persons, Dr. Kean, Supt.; Miss Morris,
assistant Supt.; the Housekeeper; the Maid of all work (who by the way is a
jewel); the Man of all work; and the new nursery maid; with the six babies making
the twelve.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite a household, for so short a time since the work was begun, and it will continue
to grow for it is getting to be better known all the while.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have received an appropriation from the County of $600. We are very glad
to get this, it will help us through the winter and in spring we hope to have an
entertainment that will bring us over $200.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have no words at my command, dear Mother, to express all I feel in regard to
our blessed work here, and of my appreciation of the great privilege you have
bestowed upon us here, in permitting us to help on our great Cause in this practical
and substantial way, but you know my heart, and what I lack in beautiful
language, I hope I can make up in faithful work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Theresa Y. Stevens.</span></p>
<p class='c006'>HOME CRUSADE IN IRELAND.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 7th the Crusaders, Mrs. A. L. Cleather and Bro. Basil Crump, went
to Dublin for the first time, where they enjoyed the real Irish hospitality of Mr. and
Mrs. P. J. Dick. Ireland is a dreamy country, and its people are extremely diffident
and hard to interest in anything novel. The deep interest of those who came
to the Wagner lecture was, therefore, no less a surprise to the local workers than
the unusually long and appreciative reports which appeared in the principal Dublin
papers. It was a significant fact that, although the reporters were supplied with a
complete summary of the lecture, they stayed to the end, and gave money for the
children’s work. This lecture was on Friday, the 9th; Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday were occupied with U. B. and private meetings, interviews, and general
routine work. On Tuesday the children’s entertainment took place in the Rotunda.
A number of Dublin ladies interested in philanthropic work came to help, and a
gentleman very kindly operated the lantern. All were delighted, and said it was
quite as much a lesson for them as for the little ones. There is no doubt that this
work will be carried forward in Dublin. Each visitor asked for a portrait of Mrs.
Tingley.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early on Wednesday morning the Crusaders, Mrs. Cleather and Bro. Crump, left
Dublin to help at the</p>
<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>BROTHERHOOD BAZAAR IN LIVERPOOL.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were met by Secretary Herbert Crooke and Brother H. M. Savage, and
stayed along with Brother Cranstone Woodhead at the “Mitre” Hotel. Some very
advantageous arrangements had been made, so that the Bazaar started on a favorable
financial basis. A beautiful picture, sent by Brother R. Machell, <abbr class='spell'>R. B. A.</abbr>, was
splendidly displayed in a large shop window in Lord Street, and attracted an immense
amount of public attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee were singularly happy in securing the sympathetic services of
Mr. R. Holt and Mrs. Jeannie Mole to open the Bazaar on the first and second days
respectively. They both made speeches which came straight from the heart, and
their appreciation of the work now being done by the Movement along practical
lines was an object lesson to all in the foresight and wisdom of our Leader. Brother
T. Baker’s orchestra provided excellent music, the refreshments were daintily
served by lady workers in tasteful costumes, and on the seven stalls there was a profusion
of articles for sale. We understand that the total receipts amounted to upwards
of £150, and we warmly congratulate the Committee on this highly successful
result.</p>
<p class='c006'>BRISTOL.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bristol reports an increase of attendence, due to copies of the <i>New Century</i> being
placed in the public libraries. <i>New Century</i> distribution is highly important work.
When the hour shall strike, when we have given it that unqualified support that it
demands of us, it will then speak right into the people’s hearts in clear and simple
language, so that none need longer question the “nobility of their calling,” or
again forget their “true position in life.”  C. O.</p>
<p class='c006'>LIVERPOOL.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lodge is flourishing, and the sole topic is the “Bazaar.” The Thursday
evening meetings have been very interesting during November.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday, November 20th, Brother Bern lectured on “Music.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 24th November Brother Crooke gave an excellent lecture on “King Solomon’s
Seal.” To all our brethren, greeting.—<span class='sc'>J. F. Cropper.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>From <i>The Crusader</i>, Dec. 27, 1898.</p>
<p class='c006'>HOLLAND.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that you are in a whirlwind of work. Here, too, we are, after our own
way in a whirlwind of the same kind, and things are going well. We are busy with
preparations for our Lotus circle, etc., and, as for <abbr class='spell'>U. B.</abbr> work, it goes in every way
as far as our means allow. Inward work is very good, and the true members are
coming nearer to each other in conscious unity. We only know our Leader here,
and try to follow her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although American in centre, this school is international in character—“a
temple of living light, lighting up the dark places of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Through this School and its branches the children of the race will be
taught the laws of physical life, and the laws of physical, moral, and mental health

will become passionate lovers of all that breathes. They will grow strong in an
understanding of themselves, and as they gain strength they will learn to use it
for the good of the whole world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Leader and Official Head wishes it known that there is an Eastern and
Esoteric School in which a very large number of the earnest members of the <span class='sc'>Universal

institution where students go to learn these teachings. The studies are carried on
in each group under directions from the centre in New York.</p>

<p class='c006'>OBITUARY.</p>

<p class='c007'>We deeply regret to record the passing away on Dec. 30, of Bro. H. T. Lotter, one
of the most faithful and earnest workers in Kansas City, after an illness lasting
since last Aug. The following resolutions were passed by Lodge No. 47 of Universal
Brotherhood, Kansas City, Mo.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Whereas</i> In the economy of Nature, all is subject to change, that which we see
being the blossom of seed sown in the long ago in the yesterdays of Eternity which
in their turn shall bear seed for futurity’s growth; and</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Whereas</i> Time in its onward sweep has closed the Cycle of Active life of him who
was erstwhile known to us as Henry T. Lotter gathering for further unfoldment the
ripened fruit of an Earth life; now therefore be it</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span> That in the passing hence of brother Lotter this lodge loses an earnest,
enthusiastic and untiring worker in the Cause, its members a staunch, sincere and
kind brother and an amiable and gracious friend; and further be it</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span> That in token of our love and esteem, flowers shall be placed on the
rostrum at the public meetings to be held Jan. 8, 15, 22d and that three members be
appointed to address the audience in memoriam, also be it</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span> That our recollections of him can best be kept in our memories, by
making his conduct in life our standard of duty.</p>

oldest workers on the Pacific Coast, Bro. Theodore G. Ed. Wollet of San Francisco,
on Dec. 12th, aged 70 years, and Dr. John S. Cook of Sacramento, on Dec. 30th.
Both of our brothers will be much missed by their respective Lodges, but the memory
of their faithful endeavor for Universal Brotherhood will long be kept in the

to explain the same subjects in a form for general circulation.</p>

Nature, and the earlier and pure conception of him
was of a beauteous but manly figure, attended by the
Graces and presiding over dramatic representations
of Nature’s mysteries. It was only in later times that
he appeared as Bacchus, the God of wine and intoxication,
attended by Bacchantes, and presiding over
sensual and drunken orgies.</p>
